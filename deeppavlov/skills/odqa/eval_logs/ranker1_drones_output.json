At least some of the balloons were launched from the Austrian ship Vulcano. Although some of the balloons worked and successfully managed to bomb The Republic, others were caught in a change of wind and blown back over Austrian lines. This occurred on the first launch as the wind was not in Austria's favor on July 12, 1849 The Austrians had been developing this system for 66 years, since the idea was hatched in 1783. The Presse, of Vienna, Austria, stated: \"Venice is to be bombarded by balloons, as the lagunes prevent the approaching of artillery. Five balloons, each measuring 5.7 meters in diameter, are in construction at Treviso. In a favorable wind the balloons will be launched and directed as near to Venice as possible, and on their being brought to vertical positions over the town, they will be fired by electro magnetism by means of a long isolated copper wire with a large galvanic battery placed on a building. The bomb falls perpendicularly, and explodes on reaching the ground.\" Balloons do not generally meet today's definition of a UAV. Once winged aircraft had been invented, the effort to fly them unmanned for military purposes was not far behind.", "The first pilotless aircraft were built during and shortly after World War I. Leading the way, using A. M. Low's radio control techniques, was the Ruston Proctor Aerial Target of 1916. If developed further it was to have been used against Zeppelins.

Five balloons, each measuring 5.7 meters in diameter, are in construction at Treviso. In a favorable wind the balloons will be launched and directed as near to Venice as possible, and on their being brought to vertical positions over the town, they will be fired by electro magnetism by means of a long isolated copper wire with a large galvanic battery placed on a building.

Although some of the balloons worked and successfully managed to bomb The Republic, others were caught in a change of wind and blown back over Austrian lines.

Five balloons, each measuring 5.7 meters in diameter, are in construction at Treviso. In a favorable wind the balloons will be launched and directed as near to Venice as possible, and on their being brought to vertical positions over the town, they will be fired by electro magnetism by means of a long isolated copper wire with a large galvanic battery placed on a building.

As a result, today there are no requirements on the part of aviation regulators on how an unmanned aerial vehicle should be equipped.", "The priority tasks of the VRT300 Arctic Supervision complex are the development of the Northern Sea Route transport system, as well as assistance in the development of the Arctic. For this purpose, the complex is equipped with an onboard side-scan radar of the X-band high resolution, which allows us to quickly assess the dynamics of the ice situation. The presence of an engine on \"heavy\" fuel and the possibility of ship basing makes the Arctic version of the VRT300 irreplaceable both on icebreakers and on drilling platforms.", "Maintenance and maintenance of UAVs is cheaper than similar costs for manned aircraft. After all, planes and helicopters need to maintain safety systems and protect pilots. Specialists managing and servicing aircraft and helicopters must undergo training, retraining, and medical commissions. The time and financial costs for drones are incommensurably lower.", "A significant advantage of unmanned vehicles is their patency and transport accessibility - they will reach the land areas, where to reach by land or by plane, is problematic. The speed of delivery of goods is another weighty argument \"for\". The unmanned aerial vehicle reaches a remote land site in 30 minutes, and a helicopter - for 2 hours.", "For manned aircraft, it is important to have a huge platform for takeoff and landing, while for a drones landing there is enough band of 500-600 meters, and miniature drones will easily land even on the steps near the threshold. UAVs economically consume fuel due to their compact dimensions, which is also an advantage.", "According to the Rules for the Use of the Airspace of the Russian Federation, an unmanned aerial vehicle is defined as \"an aircraft flying without a pilot (crew) on board and operated automatically in flight, by an operator from a control point or a combination of said methods.\"", "In early 2017, the news arose that the management of unmanned aerial vehicles was officially recognized in Russia as a profession, for the development of which it would be necessary to undergo training at special courses.", "Amendments to the Air Code from July 5, 2017 introduced mandatory in Russia registration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) weighing from 250 grams.", "Registration will be carried out by the company \"ZashchitaInfo Trans\" of the Ministry of Transport of Russia.", "The law on compulsory registration of all unmanned aerial vehicles heavier than 250 grams was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin on December 30, 2015, but the State Duma abolished it in 2016 due to difficulties with its implementation.", "Now, \"ProtectionEnterprises\" will identify UAVs with special RFID tags, through which it is possible to obtain information about the drones and its owner at distances up to 300 meters.", "Due to the target load of 70 kg, the complex can be used to transport various cargoes, such as products and medicines, to provide search and rescue operations and to determine the parameters of ice fields suitable for locating scientific polar stations."]}]
