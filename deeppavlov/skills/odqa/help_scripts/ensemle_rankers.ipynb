Volka, who was sitting  beside  him,  whispered proudly, \"My uncle made\\nthis sea.\" \"This sea?\" \"Yes.\" \"Your uncle?\" \"Yes.\" \"You mean to say that you\\'re Allah\\'s nephew?\" the old man sounded  very\\nsad. \"My  uncle\\'s  an  excavator  operator.

It\\'s a  typical draw!\" and shoved the  old man into\\ntheir cabin, where Omar Asaf was about to fulfil his terrible threat. \"Who\\'s the old man?\" Hottabych asked, seeing a decrepit old man moaning\\non  the  berth. Actually,  but  a  few short moments ago,  he  had  been  a\\nthirteen-year-old boy named  Zhenya Bogorad. \"And who\\'s that other old man?\" he continued, noticing Omar Asaf.

At first,  Volka was so touched by this unusual meeting of  brothers in\\nthe midst of the Arctic icebergs, and so happy for Hottabych\\'s sake, that he\\ncompletely forgot about the unfortunate Zhenya.

Of whom?\" the old man Zhenya croaked. \"Of me, 0 despicable youth!\" \"What for?\" \"For trying to trick me.\" \"You should ask my  forgiveness,\" Zhenya objected. \"I saved you and you\\nwant to kill me for it. I won\\'t ask your forgiveness!\" \"Be it  as you wish,\" Omar Asaf agreed maliciously. \"I  do not  insist. But bear in mind that you shall die in a few seconds if you do not.\" \"So what?

First, his withered, sunken cheeks became rosy; then, his bald head was\\ncovered  with white hair which soon  turned black,  as did his  heavy beard. Feeling  stronger,  Zhenya  hopped off the  berth and winked  at his friends\\nhappily.

He was deeply touched. \"What a  wonderful  old\\nman! But I  don\\'t  understand which  princes and  sheiks this Domosedov  is\\nsending his regards to. I\\'ll find out right away, though.\" \"Hottabych! Hey, Hottabych!\" he shouted when he reached the river bank. \"Come here for a minute, will  you?\" The  old man was dozing in the shade of\\nthe great oak. When he heard Volka calling, he started, jumped  to his feet,\\nand shuffled over to the boy. \"Here I am, 0 goalie of my soul,\" he panted. \"I await your orders.\" \"Come clean now. Did you write to the Central Excursion Bureau?\" \"Yes, but  I wanted  it  to be  a surprise. Did  you receive an  answer\\nalready?\" \"Sure, here it is,\" Volka said, showing the old man the letter. Hottabych snatched the paper from him. After reading the tactful answer\\nslowly,  syllable  by syllable,  he turned purple  and began to tremble  all\\nover. His  eyes  became  bloodshot. In a  great  rage  he ripped  open his\\nembroidered collar. \"I beg your pardon,\" he wheezed,  \"I beg your pardon!',\n",

For reasons  unknown, Volka  was\\ncovering his face with his hands. \"Volka!\" Bogorad shouted happily. \"Kostylkov!\" Unlike Zhenya, Volka  did  not seem at all pleased at the encounter. In\\nfact, he even  pretended not  to have recognized his best  friend. He darted\\ninto  the thick of the crowd which  stood  listening  to an orchestra  while\\nawaiting the next showing. \"Don\\'t think I care!\" Zhenya said in an offended  tone and went off to\\nbuy an ice-cream. That  is why he  didn\\'t see the people gathering round the  strange old\\nman and Volka. Later,  when  he tried to push his way  through  to the spot\\nwhich was attracting so many eager eyes,  his friend was already surrounded\\nby a rapidly-growing crowd. He could hear  the folding seats hitting against\\nthe backs  of the chairs as those who were listening to the orchestra rushed\\noff. Soon the musicians were playing to rows of empty seats. \"What happened?\" Zhenya asked, vainly trying to elbow  his way through. \"If  there\\'s been an accident,  I can phone for help. My uncle\\'s the manager\\nhere. What\\'s the matter?\" But no one seemed to know what the matter was. And, since hardly anyone\\ncould see anything and everyone wanted to know  what was going on inside the\\ncircle, they all kept  asking each other questions  and  demanding  sensible\\nanswers, until they raised such a  ruckus they began to drown out the music,\\nthough the musicians were playing as loud as they could. Zhenya\\'s  uncle  finally  appeared,  climbed on  a chair  and  shouted,\\n\"Everyone  please  disperse! What\\'s the matter? Haven\\'t  you  ever  seen  a\\nbearded child before?\" The moment these words reached the snack bar, everyone there  rushed to\\nsee the bearded child. \"Volka!\" Zhenya yelled at  the  top  of  his  voice, despairing of ever\\ngetting through the crowd. \"I can\\'t  see anything! Can you see? Does he have\\na big beard?\" \"Golly!\" the unfortunate Volka wailed. \"What if he....\"\\n     \"Poor child!\" the curious onlookers sighed. \"What a pity!\" \"Is science helpless in his case?\" At  first, Hottabych misunderstood  the attention  his young friend was\\nattracting. He  thought  the people  were  crowding round to  express their\\nrespect for Volka. Then he began to get angry. \"Disperse, my good people!\" he shouted, drowning out the noise  of the\\ncrowd and the band. \"Disperse, or I\\'ll do something terrible to all of you!\" A timid girl gasped from fear, but the others only laughed. Really now,\\nwhat was there to fear from such a funny old  man  in  silly  pink slippers? Why, if someone as much as touched him, he\\'d probably fall to pieces! No, no one took his threats seriously. However, the old man was used to\\nhaving people tremble at his words. He felt that  he  and Volka  were being\\ninsulted and was becoming more and more enraged. There is  no telling how it\\nall could have ended, if the first bell had not rung just then.',\n",

And let him not  be bothered by dreams  of owning a\\ndog,\" Hottabych thought, smiling into his beard. A  faint crystal  tinkling  issued  from under  the bed,  and  the  dog\\ndisappeared. \"Volka,  dear,\" his mother  said,  completely forgetting what  they had\\nbeen  talking about. \"If my office calls, please tell them I\\'ll be  there in\\nan hour or so.

He was curious to see how the  old doctor,  who\\nobviously had no idea what  a mighty and unusual opponent he was up against,\\nwould helplessly fumble about in search of a correct diagnosis.

Are we still barking?\" \"It\\'s awful!\" Goga moaned. \"Aha! Well then,  let\\'s just  chat  a bit. What  kind of poems do  you\\nlike?\" \"Bow-wow-wow!\" Goga barked. His mother, who  was standing just outside\\nthe door, began to sob. You can imagine what Goga wanted to reply to the old doctor\\'s question! He was  indignant  and he  considered it a foolish and unnecessary question. However, his barking neither surprised nor distressed the old doctor. \"Don\\'t  get  angry,\"  Alexander Alexeyevich said in a  very calm voice. \"This question has direct bearing on your illness.\" \"I like \\'A Winter\\'s Evening,\\' a poem by Pushkin,\" Goga finally answered\\nafter barking for a long while. \"Won\\'t you recite it for me? Do you know it by heart?\" Goga recited four lines. \"That\\'s enough!\" the doctor said. \"Now, will you please  tell  me what\\nyou think about your classmate, ah, what\\'s-his-name?

He probably\\nhas  a  special gimmick in his pocket to regulate the goals at  a  distance. Maybe he even tossed all those balls into the field?\" \"Sure, it was him,\"  Volka agreed readily,  calling forth a new wave of\\nlaughter. \"I  bet he was also responsible for the  earthquake in Chile!

That\\'s\\nshameful. Oh, how very shameful and embarrassing, my  dear man!\" Muhammedov\\npulled the old man to his feet. \"Wait a  minute!\" Volka whispered like a conspirator, taking Muhammedov\\noff to a side. \"Don\\'t pay any attention to the old man.

He\\'s  a famous\\ninnovator,  known  to  the entire  textile industry;  and Lunin  is a famous\\nengineer. And in the second place,  the  most ordinary worker in our country\\nis more respected than the  tsar of tsars. Don\\'t you believe me? Here, read\\nthis.\" Volka handed Hottabych  the paper and there, with his own eyes, he read\\nthe following heading: \"Famous People  of Our  Country,\" beneath which  were\\nover  a  dozen  photographs  of  fitters,  agronomists,  pilots,  collective\\nfarmers, weavers, teachers and carpenters. \"I would never have believed you,\" Hottabych said with a sigh. \"I would\\nnever have believed you if your words had not been corroborated on the pages\\nof this newspaper I  so respect. I beg you,  0 Volka, explain why everything\\nis so different in this wonderful country of yours?\" \"With pleasure,\" Volka answered. And sitting down on the river bank, he\\nspoke  at length and with great pride,  explaining the essence of the Soviet\\nsystem to Hottabych. There is no use repeating their long conversation. \"All  you have  said is as wise as  it is noble. And to anyone who  is\\nhonest  and just  all  this gives  plenty to  think  about,\"  Hottabych said\\ncandidly when  his first lesson  in current events was  over.

I have \\'B\\'s in three subjects.\" \"Your every wish is my command,\" Hottabych replied and bowed low. The old  man  was  as  good as his word. He did not lay  a finger on a\\nsingle employee of the Central Excursion Bureau. He  just arranged  matters so, that  when our three friends boarded the\\n\"Ladoga,\"  they were met very warmly and were given an excellent  cabin; and\\nno  one  ever inquired  why  in the  world  they had been  included  in  the\\npassenger list-it simply did not occur to anyone to ask such a question.

The  following message was stencilled\\non each and every crate:\\n     \"For  the  passengers and  the  members  of the  fearless  crew  of the\\n\\'Ladoga,\\' from a citizen who wishes to remain anonymous.\" One  does  not  have to be especially  clever to guess  that these were\\nHottabych\\'s gifts: he did not want the  three of them  to  take  part in the\\nexpedition at someone else\\'s expense.',\n",

Varvara  Stepanovna  suggested,  \"What  if  we  ask the  child  another\\nquestion, just to calm him? Say, from last year\\'s book. Last year he got an\\n\\'A\\' in geography.\" The others agreed,  and  Varvara  Stepanovna once again turned  to  the\\nunhappy boy. \"Now, Kostylkov, wipe your tears  and don\\'t be nervous. Tell us  what a\\nhorizon is.\" \"A horizon?\" Volka said  with new hope. \"That\\'s easy. A horizon is an\\nimagined line which....\"\\n     But Hottabych came to life behind the  wall again and  Volka once again\\nbecame the victim of prompting. \"The horizon, 0 my most revered one,\" Volka corrected himself, \"I would\\ncall the horizon that brink, where the crystal cupola of the Heavens touches\\nthe edge of the Earth.\" \"It gets worse as  he goes on,\" Varvara Stepanovna  moaned. \"How  would\\nyou  have  us  understand  your  words  about  the  crystal  cupola  of  the\\nHeavens-literally or figuratively?\" \"Literally, 0 teacher,\" Hottabych prompted from the next room. And Volka was obliged to repeat after him, \"Literally, 0 teacher.\" \"Figuratively!\" someone  hissed  from the  back of the  room. But Volka\\nrepeated, \"Naturally, in the literal sense and no other.\" \"What does that  mean?\" Varvara Stepanovna asked, still not  believing\\nher ears. \"Does that mean you consider the sky to be a solid cupola?\" \"Yes.\" \"And does it mean there\\'s a place where the Earth ends?\" \"Yes, there is, 0 my most highly respected teacher.\" Behind  the  wall  Hottabych  nodded approvingly  and  rubbed his hands\\ntogether smugly. A strange silence  fell on the class. Even those who were always  ready\\nto laugh stopped smiling. Something was definitely wrong with Volka. Varvara\\nStepanovna rose and felt his forehead anxiously. He did not have a fever. But Hottabych was really touched by this. He  bowed low and touched his\\nforehead and chest in the Eastern manner and then began to  whisper. Volka,\\ndriven by the same awful force, repeated his movements exactly. \"I thank you,  0 most gracious daughter of Stepan! I thank you for your\\ntrouble. But it is unnecessary, because, praised be Allah, I am quite well.\" All this  sounded  extremely  strange  and funny. However,  the  other\\nchildren were so worried  about Volka that  not a shade of a smile crossed a\\nsingle  face. Varvara Stepanovna  took  him by  the hand, led him out of the\\nroom, and patted his lowered head. \"Never mind, Kostylkov. Don\\'t worry. You\\'re  probably overtired.

Soon  attendants in crimson and gold uniforms lined up along both sides\\nof the entrance to the arena. The ring-master announced the first act. A bare-back rider dressed in a\\nsequined suit and looking like a Christmas tree ornament rode into the ring. \"Do you like it?\" Volka asked Hottabych. \"It is not devoid of interest, and it is pleasant to the eye,\" the  old\\nman replied cautiously. The bare-back  rider  was  followed  by acrobats,  who were followed by\\nclowns, who were followed by a  dog act-this attraction met with Hottabych\\'s\\nreserved praise-who were followed by jugglers and spring-board jumpers. Then\\nthere was an intermission. It  was a shame to  leave and miss the second half of the  show, but  a\\ngeography book opened at the very first chapter awaited Volka at home.

They had to  think of  something urgently,  but, fearing\\nfor  Varvara Stepanovna\\'s very  life, Volka was  completely at a  loss. His\\nteeth  even began to chatter.

Then, with  a  sound  like\\ntinkling crystalware,  he  yanked a hair from his beard and tore it in  two.

It kept getting  warmer and\\nwarmer. The icicles on Hottabych\\'s beard and on the fringes melted;  the icy\\ncrust that had  covered the rest of the carpet also melted. Hottabych turned\\nover  on his  side, yawned and began  to snore  with  a whistle, as if there\\nreally was a pipe in his nose. Zhenya  woke  up  from the  dampness  and  the warmth. Leaning  towards\\nVolka\\'s chilled ear he whispered:\\n     \"Do tell me who the old man is?\" \"Come clean,\"  Volka  whispered back, keeping  a wary eye on Hottabych. \"Did you want to talk to the fellows about me behind my back?\" \"What of it?\" \"Just that he doesn\\'t like it.\" \"What doesn\\'t he like?\" \"He doesn\\'t like people to go blabbering about me!\" \"Humph!\" \"Humph yourself! Presto! And you\\'re in a desert. It\\'s all very-simple.\" Zhenya wasn\\'t convinced. Volka  cast another  wary glance at  Hottabych and  moved closer to his\\nfriend\\'s ear. \"Do you think I\\'m crazy?\" \"What a silly question!\" \"Not even a bit?\" \"Of course not.\" \"Well, believe  it or not,  but this  old man  is a Genie, a real  live\\nGenie from the Arabian Nights!\" \"Boloney!\" \"And he was the one who got everything  messed  up during the  exam. He\\nprompted me and I had to repeat everything like a parrot.\" \"Him?!\" \"But don\\'t say a word about my  having failed. He swore to kill all the\\nteachers if they failed me. And now I\\'m knocking myself out  to save Varvara\\nStepanovna  from  his  magic. I have to keep distracting him all  the  time. Understand?\" \"Not really.\" \"Well, be quiet anyway!\" \"Don\\'t  worry, I will,\" Zhenya whispered thoughtfully. \"Then he was the\\none who tossed me into India?\" \"Sure he was. And he got you back from India, too. If you want to know,\\nhe sent you there so they could sell you into slavery.\" Zhenya giggled. \"Me, a slave? Ha-ha-ha!\" \"Ssh!

Here\\'s the  vessel which  I have spent  so  many  sleepless nights  dreaming\\nabout!\" Hottabych continued, waving his find overhead. \"Here, 0 Volka, open it, to the joy of my brother Omar and myself!\" Pressing his ear  to the side of  the vessel, he laughed happily, \"Oho,\\nmy friends! Omar is signalling to me from within!\" There was  envy in Zhenya\\'s eyes  as he  watched the  old  man  hand  a\\nnattered Volka the vessel, or, rather, lay it at Volka\\'s feet, since it  was\\nso heavy. \"But didn\\'t you  say that Omar was imprisoned in a  copper vessel? This\\none\\'s  made of iron. Oh well, no  matter.... Where\\'s the  seal? Aha, here it\\nis!\" Volka said, inspecting the vessel carefully from all sides. Suddenly he turned pale and shouted:\\n     \"Quick, lie down! Zhenya, lie down! Hottabych, throw it right back into\\nthe water and lie down!\" \"You\\'re mad!\" Hottabych said indignantly. \"I\\'ve dreamed  of our meeting\\nfor so many years, and now, after finding him, you want me to throw him back\\nto the waves.\" \"Throw it  as far out  as you  can! Your Omar  isn\\'t inside! Hurry, or\\nwe\\'ll all  be  dead!\" Volka pleaded. Since the old  man still hesitated,  he\\nyelled at the top of his voice, \"It is an order! Do you hear?!\" Shrugging in dismay, Hottabych raised the heavy object, heaved  it  and\\ntossed it at least 200 yards from the shore. Before he  had  a chance to turn for an  explanation towards Volka, who\\nwas  standing  beside him, there  was a terrible  explosion at  the spot the\\nvessel hit the  water. A huge pillar of water rose over the calm surface  of\\nthe lagoon and fell apart with a loud crash. Thousands of stunned and killed\\nfish floated bellies up on the waves. People were already running towards them, attracted by the sound of the\\nexplosion. \"Let\\'s run!\" Volka commanded. They hurried to the highway and headed towards the city. A grieved Hottabych lagged behind and kept turning round constantly. He\\nwas still not convinced that he had done right by obeying Volka. \"What  did  you see on the thing?\" Zhenya  asked when  he had caught up\\nwith Volka, who was way ahead of him and Hottabych.\\n     \" \\'Made in USA,\\' that\\'s what!\" \"So it was a bomb.\" \"No, it  was a  mine. There\\'s  a big difference! It  was an underwater\\nmine.\" Hottabych sighed sadly. When Hottabych  saw that Omar was  not to be found in the Mediterranean\\nSea, he suggested that they set out to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. The\\nsuggestion in itself was extremely tempting. However, Volka was unexpectedly\\nagainst it. He said that he had  to be in Moscow the  following day without\\nfail.',\n",

Omar  Asaf, seeing  that he was a minority of  one,  pretended to agree\\nabout the Gulf Stream, but actually concealed a grudge against Volka and his\\nfriend. \"I am tired of  arguing with  you, 0 conceited boy,\" he said, forcing a\\nyawn. \"I am tired and want to sleep. Hurry and bring a fan and keep away the\\nflies while I rest.\" \"In the first place, there are no flies here. In the second place, what\\nright have you to order me about?\" Volka asked indignantly. \"There will  be flies soon enough,\" Omar Asaf muttered through clenched\\nteeth. And sure enough, swarms of flies began buzzing about the cabin. \"We can manage without a fan,\" Volka said in  a friendlier tone, making\\nbelieve he did not understand the humiliating nature of Omar Asaf\\'s demand. He opened first  the door, then the port-hole; a strong draught carried\\nthe flies out into the corridor. \"All the same, you\\'ll fan  me!\" Omar Asaf said  capriciously,  ignoring\\nHottabych\\'s attempts at calming him. \"No, I won\\'t! No one has ever made me fulfil humiliating orders.\" \"Then I\\'ll be the first to do so.\" \"No you won\\'t!\" \"Omar, my sweet!\" Hottabych said, trying to avert the imminent quarrel. But Omar Asaf, who had turned black with rage, waved him away angrily. \"I\\'d rather die than fulfil your whims!\" Volka shouted. \"Then you\\'ll  die  very  soon,  as  soon as  the  Sun  sets,\" Omar Asaf\\nannounced, smiling disgustingly. Suddenly, Volka had a wonderful idea. \"If that\\'s the case, then tremble, you despicable Genie!\" he shouted in\\nhis most  terrible voice. \"You have tried my patience  too  long, and I must\\nstop the Sun! It will not  go down today, or tomorrow, or the day after. You\\nhave only yourself to blame!\" Volka was taking a big chance. If  Hottabych had  had  time to tell his\\nbrother that the Arctic Sun shone twenty-four hours a  day  at this  time of\\nthe year, then all was lost. But  in  reply  to  Volka\\'s  words,  Omar  Asaf  scoffed, \"Braggart  of\\nbraggarts! Boaster of boasters!

And not only saved, but that he could take\\nHottabych\\'s disagreeable brother in hand. Hottabych, meanwhile, winked approvingly at Volka. As for Zhenya, there\\nis no need to say he was  delighted. He had guessed Volka\\'s  idea  and  was\\naglow from excitement, anticipating Omar Asaf\\'s imminent downfall. \"Rest assured, Omar Asaf.

Suddenly  a  shrill whistle\\nsounded on deck. They could hear the heavy clatter of running feet. \"That\\'s the militia  coming to fine someone!\" Zhenya joked. \"Somebody\\'s\\njumped overboard  at full speed!\" No  one  had  time  to laugh, because  the\\n\"Ladoga\" shuddered  and something  clanged menacingly  below. For the second\\ntime that day the ship came to a stop. \"See! What did I  say!\" Zhenya  hissed  and looked  at Hottabych  with\\nloathing. \"He couldn\\'t control himself. Just look at him boast!

My best merci to you!\" \"Not  a snake,  a  serpent, for know ye that a  serpent  is  the living\\nembodiment of wisdom.\" This time the old man was really not to  blame. The  \"Ladoga\"  had lost\\nits  way in the fog and gone aground. Passengers crowded the deck, but they\\nhad  difficulty in  even  making out the rails. However, by leaning over the\\nside  near the bow  they  could see the  propellers  churning  up  the  dark\\nunfriendly waters. Half an hour passed, but all attempts to get the ship off  the shoal by\\nputting it in reverse  ended in  failure. Then the captain ordered  the spry\\nboatswain to pipe all on deck. Everyone  except those  standing watch  gathered  on  the spardeck. The\\ncaptain said, \"Comrades, this is  an emergency. There\\'s only one way to  get\\noff the  shoal under our own steam and that\\'s transfer the coal from the bow\\nto the stern; then we\\'ll be able make free of the shoal.

The Shaiba defence  had become  unkeyed from their  long  idleness  and\\ncould not collect their wits quickly to  ward  off  the  unexpected  danger. Their goalie was  really something  to look at. There he sat on  the  grass,\\nshelling melon seeds. Choking,  he jumped to  his feet,  but the Zubilo players  had  already\\nkicked the ball straight towards the centre of the unprotected goal. Just  then,  to the  great  torment of our young  friends, they heard a\\nclear  crystal tinkling. Yes, Hottabych had finally been able to find a dry\\nhair in his beard. Oh,  Zhenya, Zhenya!

Let the Zubilo  players score  at\\nleast once!\" Volka wailed. But  Hottabych pretended to hear  nothing. The  ball, which was flying\\nstraight at  the centre  of the  goal,  suddenly swerved to the left and hit\\nagainst the  post with such force that it flew back across the  whole field,\\ncareful to avoid the Zubilo players in its way, as though it was alive. Then\\nit rolled softly into the long-suffering Zubilo goal! \"24:0!\" This was an amazing score, considering that the teams were equal. Volka lost his temper completely. \"I demand-no, I order you to stop this mockery immediately!\" he hissed. \"Otherwise, I\\'ll never be  friends with you again! You have your choice: the\\nShaiba team or me!\" \"Why,  you\\'re  a  football   fan  yourself. Can\\'t  you  understand  my\\nfeelings?\" the old man  pleaded, but he sensed from Volka\\'s expression that\\nthis time their friendship might really end. And so, he  whispered back,  \"I\\nawait your further orders.\" \"The Zubilo team isn\\'t to blame that  you\\'re  a Shaiba fan. You\\'ve made\\nthem the laughing-stock of the country. Make it so that everyone should see\\nthey\\'re not to blame for losing.\" \"I hear and I obey, 0 young goalie of my soul!\" No sooner had the umpire\\'s whistle died down, announcing the end of the\\nfirst time, than the entire Zubilo team began to sneeze and cough for all it\\nwas worth. Forming  a semblance of a formation, they dragged their feet listlessly\\nto their locker room, sneezing and coughing loudly. A  moment  later a  doctor was summoned, since all eleven  players were\\nfeeling ill. The doctor felt each one\\'s pulse in turn, he asked them to take\\noff their  shirts,  then  looked  in  their mouths and  finally summoned the\\numpire. \"I\\'m afraid you\\'ll have to call off the game.\" \"Why?

But,\\nof course, they never  dreamed how  great  a  danger they had  avoided.

The  Shaiba  players  were out-manoeuvring  the defence  and were  fast\\napproaching the Zubilo goal. Barn! The second goal in three minutes! And  it had not been the Zubilo\\ngoalie\\'s fault either time. He was  fighting like a tiger. But what could he\\ndo? At  the moment  the ball was hit, the cross-bar rose of its own  accord,\\njust high enough to let it pass through, brushing the tips of his fingers. Whom could he complain to? Who would ever believe him? The goalie  felt\\nscared  and forlorn, just like a  little boy who finds himself in the middle\\nof a forest at night. \"See that?\" he asked Yegor in a hopeless voice. \"I th-th-th-ink I did,\"\\nthe spare player stuttered. \"But you c-c-c-an\\'t tell anyone, n-n-no one will\\never  b-b-believe you.\" \"That\\'s just it, no  one\\'ll believe me,\" the  goalie\\nagreed  sadly. Just then,  a  quiet  scandal  was taking place in the  North\\nSection. A  moment  before  the  second goal,  Volka  noticed  the old  man\\nfurtively yank a hair from his beard. \"What  did he do  that for?\" he wondered uneasily, still unaware of the\\nstorm gathering over the field. However, even this thought did  not  come to\\nVolka immediately. The game was going so badly for the  Zubilo team that he had no time to\\nthink of the old man. But soon everything became perfectly clear. The first  half of the game was nearing an end, and it seemed that Luck\\nhad finally turned its face towards the Zubilo team, The ball was now on the\\nShaiba side of the field. The Zubilo men were ploughing up the earth, as the\\nsaying  goes, and soon their best forward  kicked the ball  with  tremendous\\nforce into the top corner of the Shaiba goal. All one hundred thousand fans  jumped to their feet. This sure goal was\\nto give the team its first point. Volka  and Zhenya, two ardent Zubilo fans,\\nwinked happily to  each other, but immediately groaned  with disappointment:\\nit was  a sure  goal, but the ball smacked against  the cross-bar so  loudly\\nthat the sound echoed all over the stadium. This sound was echoed by a loud wail from the Shaiba goalie:\\n     the lowered cross-bar had fouled a goal, but it had knocked him smartly\\non the head. Now Volka understood all and was terrified. \"Hassan  Abdurrakhman  ibn Hottab,\" he said in a shaking voice. \"What\\'s\\nthis  I see? You know both Zhenya and  I are  Zubilo fans, and here you are,\\nagainst us! You\\'re a Shaiba fan!\" \"Alas, 0 blessed one, it is so!\" the old man replied unhappily. \"Didn\\'t  I  save  you  from imprisonment  in  the  clay vessel?\" Volka\\ncontinued bitterly. \"This is  as true as  the fact that  it  is now day and that there is a\\ngreat future ahead of you,\" Hottabych replied in a barely audible voice.',\n",

He would have written to some  ministry or  other. But\\nwhich ministry? And what was he to say? By now  the readers of this  book know Volka  well enough to agree that\\nhe\\'s  no  cry-baby.

THE UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER\\n\\n\\n     If  you  recall,  dear  readers,  it  was  a  hot  July noon  when  the\\nice-breaker \"Ladoga\" sailed from  the Red  Pier in  the port of  Arkhangelsk\\nwith a large group of excursionists on board.

After  exchanging  opinions  on   boats,  diesel  ships,  ice-breakers,\\ntug-boats, schooners,  trawlers, cutters, and other types of craft  skimming\\nover the surface of the Northern  Dvina,  the boys fell silent, enchanted by\\nthe beauty of the great river. \"Isn\\'t that something!\" Volka said  in a voice that seemed to imply  he\\nwas responsible for all this beauty. \"Uh-huh.\" \"Nobody\\'d believe it if you told them.\" \"Uh-huh!\" \"I\\'m really glad that we. ..\" Volka began after a long pause and looked\\naround cautiously to see if Hottabych was anywhere  nearby. Just in case, he\\ncontinued in a whisper, \"... that we\\'ve taken the old  man away from Varvara\\nStepanovna for at least a month.\" \"Sure,\" Zhenya agreed. \"There\\'s  the  Mate  in  charge  of the  passengers,\" Volka  whispered,\\nnodding towards a young sailor with a freckled face.

What a strange fellow! \"A real sailor is a  guest on  shore and at home at sea!\" the Passenger\\nMate said weightily. \"Did you ever hear that saying?\" \"Well, I can\\'t say I\\'m a real sailor, since I\\'m only a waiter.\" \"Then get one dinner in the  galley and take it  to Cabin 14, to a lady\\nnamed Koltsova.\" \"That\\'s  the same last name as Varvara  Stepanovna has,\" Volka remarked\\nto Zhenya. \"Uh-huh.\" \"She\\'s  a middle-aged lady and  she caught cold on the  way here,\"  the\\nMate  explained. \"It\\'s nothing  very serious,\" he said,  as  if to  calm the\\nwaiter, though the latter did not appear  in  any  way alarmed at the lady\\'s\\nstate  of health.',\n",

No other\\nboy  in his place  could ever have  been  able to stay  away so long and not\\nboast to his friends about his real, pure-breed puppy. And Goga, especially,\\nwould have gloated to see the children so envious. There was something strange about it all. Finally, Volka could not keep\\nfrom  asking  Goga\\'s  mother  what  the  matter  was. She  became  terribly\\nembarrassed and mumbled something about  her dear  boy being sick.

Is it?\" \"What Alsatian?\" the poor woman shrugged. \"The  puppy you gave  Goga. You  know, the one that\\'s barking. Is it an\\nAlsatian or a Boxer?\" \"Goodness, what nonsense!\" she sighed and disappeared quickly  into her\\napartment. As if for spite, a high-pitched angry barking issued forth. It was all very mysterious. Just then Hottabych,  who  was lying in  his usual  place under Volka\\'s\\nbed, asked casually:\\n     \"I wonder how your enemy named Pill is getting on?\" He  yearned to boast  about the  cunning spell  he  had cast on him and\\nshare with Volka his delight in the trouble Goga was deservedly having. \"No  one  but I  can ever break the spell,\"  he thought. \"I  can  just\\nimagine how the most greatly-respected Volka ibn Alyosha will be pleased and\\nhow amazed he will be at the endless variety of my powers.\" \"Pill?\" Volka repeated  absently, for he had  just  thought  of  a very\\nsimple  and  tempting  idea. \"Pill? He\\'s  not  feeling  too  good. Listen,\\nHottabych,\" he crouched down and stuck his head  under the bed,  in order to\\ncarry on negotiations more comfortably. \"I  want  to  ask  you  for  a  big\\nfavour.\" \"This is it,\" the old Genie thought unhappily. He suspected that  Volka\\nwas about to ask him  to break the spell he had cast on Goga; and he decided\\nto  refuse flatly. At least for the  time being. It wouldn\\'t hurt the horrid\\ntattle-tale and gossip to suffer a bit. It would only do him good. However. Hottabych replied sourly:\\n     \"I\\'ll be only too happy to know your wish.\" \"I want to ask you for a present.\"',\n",

What if he could profit from  Hottabych\\'s\\nabsence  and  take his geography  examination right there, in  the  doctor\\'s\\noffice? \"By no  means!\" Pyotr Ivanych said emphatically. \"By no means.

When  he put the  kettle down and\\nturned around,  both  Volka  Kostylkov  and  his  mysterious  companion  had\\ndisappeared.

Hottabych beamed. \"I  expected nothing else! But for a moment  there I\\nthought that the  most revered  daughter of Stepan  was  displeased with the\\nbreadth and scope of your knowledge.\" \"Oh,  no,  no!\" Volka cried  in  fear,  recalling Hottabych\\'s  terrible\\nthreats. \"You were imagining things.\" \"I would have changed her into  a chopping block on which butchers chop\\nup mutton,\" the old man  said fiercely (and Volka was really frightened  for\\nhis teacher\\'s fate), \"if I  hadn\\'t seen that  she had such great respect for\\nyou and took you to the door of your classroom and then practically down the\\nstairs.',\n",

However, the sigh  his\\nyoung saviour  heaved  to  accompany his sad and honourable  words convinced\\nHottabych that Volka ibn Alyosha needed his help more than ever before. \"Your  refusal  grieves me,\" Hottabych  said. \"After all,  no one  will\\nnotice me prompting you.\" \"Ha!\" Volka said bitterly. \"You don\\'t know what keen  ears our  teacher\\nVarvara Stepanovna has.\" \"You not only upset me, you  now offend me,  0  Volka  ibn  Alyosha!

At any rate, he was convinced he knew how to do so. All that was  needed was\\nto  give a  person  that which he had always longed for. But  what kind of a\\npresent should he give Volka? The  answer came to him quite  by chance when\\nVolka asked a passer-by:\\n     \"Would you please tell me what time it is?\" The man looked at his watch and said, \"Five to two.\" \"Thank you,\" Volka said and continued on in silence.

Thanking him in the most elaborate oriental manner, Hottabych said with\\na sly grin:\\n     \"May I be permitted,  0 loveliest of all Volkas,  to inquire  as to the\\ntime of day?\" And there was a watch  shining  on Volka\\'s left wrist, exactly like the\\none the man they had stopped had, but instead of being chrome-plated, it was\\nof the purest gold. \"May it be worthy of your hand  and your kind heart,\" Hottabych said in\\na touched voice, basking in Volka\\'s happiness and surprise. Then Volka did something that any other boy  or girl would have done in\\nhis place,  having  found themselves  the  proud  possessors of their  first\\nwatch. He raised his arm to his ear to hear it tick. \"O-o-o-o,\" he drawled. \"It\\'s not wound. I\\'ll have to wind  it.\" To his\\ngreat disappointment, he found he could not move the winding button. Then he\\ngot out his  pen-knife to open the watch case. However, try as he would,  he\\ncould not find a trace of a slit in which to insert the knife. \"It\\'s made of solid gold,\" the old man boasted and winked. \"I\\'m not one\\nof those people who give presents made of hollow gold.\" \"Does  that  mean  there\\'s  nothing inside  of it?\" Volka  asked  with\\ndisappointment. \"Why,  should  there  be  anything  inside?\" the  old  Genie  inquired\\nanxiously.

In a word, if you ever  forget something very  important and just can\\'t\\nrecall it, there\\'s no better remedy than to fall off a magic carpet, if even\\nfor  a second. Such  a fall really clears one\\'s memory. At least it  helped\\nHottabych recall how to break spells he himself had cast.

Once again  they\\'d hear  the plink, once again the moan of\\ndespair, and the despondent mumbling of the old Genie. \"Hey, Volka,\" Zhenya said, \"What\\'s this we\\'re flying  on? It looks like\\na magic carpet.\" \"That\\'s exactly what it is. Hottabych, what\\'s taking you so long?\" \"There\\'s no such thing as a magic carpet,\" Zhenya said. \"Help!\" The carpet had dipped sharply.

Alas, my beard is wet!\" \"Ha, what a thing to worry about!\" Zhenya smirked. \"My beard  is  wet!\" Hottabych  repeated  in terrible  grief. \"I\\'m  as\\nhelpless  as a babe.

An approving murmur passed through the\\ncrowd  and a stout man  said to his  neighbour: \"I told you that the old man\\nwas one of them. You can tell he\\'s a very experienced clown. Look how funny\\nhe is. Sometimes they sit in with the audience on purpose.\" Fortunately  for the man, Hottabych heard nothing of what \\'he said,  as\\nhe was  engrossed in watching the magician. Sidorelli was about to begin his\\nmost difficult trick. First of all, the famous illusionist set fire  to several long coloured\\nribbons and stuffed them into his mouth. Then he picked up a large, brightly\\ncoloured bowl filled with something that looked like sawdust. He stuffed his\\nmouth full of the sawdust  and began to fan himself quickly with a beautiful\\ngreen fan. The sawdust in his mouth began to smoulder.

Then,  amidst  a  storm of applause  and  shouts of Bravo! Hottabych\\'s\\nindignant voice could be heard. \"It\\'s  a fake!\" he shouted at the top of  his  lungs. \"That\\'s no magic! It\\'s simple sleight-of-hand!\" \"Isn\\'t he something!\" someone shouted. \"A  wonderful  clown! Bravo, clown!\" And everyone  present except Volka\\nand his friend applauded Hottabych enthusiastically. The old man did not understand which clown they were shouting about. He\\nwaited for the applause he had inspired to die down and continued acidly:\\n     \"What kind of magic is that! Ha, ha, ha!\" He  shoved  the  thunderstruck  magician aside. To begin with, fifteen\\ntremendous multi-coloured flames shot from his mouth; they were so real that\\na smell of burning filled the circus. The  applause was  balm  to Hottabych\\'s  heart. Then  he  snapped  his\\nfingers, and instead of one large Sidorelli, seventy-two tiny Sidorellis ran\\noff in single file along the barrier surrounding the arena. After completing\\nseveral circles, they blended into one  large Sidorelli  again, just as tiny\\ndrops of mercury roll together to form a large drop. \"That\\'s not  all!\" Hottabych thundered  in a  voice that was no  longer\\nhuman. He was excited  by the admiration he had aroused,  and began to draw\\nforth herds of horses from under the flaps of his jacket. The  horses whinnied with fear, they pawed the  ground and tossed their\\nheads, making their lovely silken manes blow. Then, at a signal from the old\\nman, the  horses  disappeared. Instead, four  huge,  roaring  African  lions\\njumped out from under his  jacket. They raced around the arena several times\\nand also disappeared. There was an unending storm of applause from that moment on. Hottabych waved his hand and everything on the arena- Sidorelli and his\\nassistants, and his various  props, and the elegant uniformed attendants-all\\nshot into the air, completed several farewell circles  over the heads of the\\nastounded audience, and dissolved into nothing.

It\\'s  just  that  we\\'re  late  for  the  last  day-time\\nperformance! You have to be sixteen  to get in now. I really don\\'t know what\\nto do, \\'cause I don\\'t feel like going home.\" \"You won\\'t go home!\" Hottabych cried. \"In a twinkling of an eye they\\'ll\\nlet  us  through, surrounded by  the respect your truly endless capabilities\\ncommand!

At the entrance to the projection room stood Zhenya Bogorad, the envy\\nof every pupil of 6B. This darling of fate was the  theatre manager\\'s nephew\\nand  therefore permitted to attend evening performances. But  today, instead\\nof being the happiest  of boys, he was suffering terribly. He was suffering\\nfrom loneliness. He  was dying to have a companion, someone he could talk to\\nabout Volka Kostylkov\\'s  behaviour at  the  morning\\'s geography examination. Alas!

This is Hottabych. Despite all  his\\nefforts, he has not been able  to  procure a job as a radio-operator on some\\npolar station. His appearance alone, with the  long grey beard  reaching  down  to his\\nwaist, a sure sign of his undoubtedly advanced age,  is a great hindrance in\\nfinding  employment in the  harsh conditions of  the  Arctic. However,  his\\nsituation  becomes still more  hopeless  when  he  begins  to  fill  in  the\\napplication form. In answer  to  the  question:  \"Occupation,\" he  writes:  \"Professional\\nGenie.\" In  answer to the question: \"Age,\" he writes: \"3,732 years and  five\\nmonths.\" As to family  status, he replies simple-heartedly: \"Orphan. Single. I have a brother named Omar Asaf who, until  July of last year, lived on the\\nbottom of the Arctic Ocean in a copper vessel, but who now works as an Earth\\nsatellite,\" etc., etc., etc. After  reading his application form, the personnel manager decides that\\nHottabych is slightly crazy, though the readers  of our story know  only too\\nwell that what the old man has written is nothing but the truth. Naturally, it would be no trouble for him at all to become  a young man\\nand to fill in the form as it should be; or, if the worst came to the worst,\\nto cast the same spell on the personnel manager as he had once before,  when\\nhe and his friends boarded the \"Ladoga.\" But the trouble  is the old man has\\ndecided he wants to get a job in the Arctic honestly, without any fakery  at\\nall. However,  he  has  been  visiting  the  Board  offices  less  and  less\\nfrequently  lately. Instead,  he has decided to study radio  technology,  to\\nlearn how to design his own radio equipment. Knowing  his abilities and his\\nlove for  work,  it is not  such a hopeless matter. What  he needs  now are\\ncompetent teachers. Hottabych wants his  young friends  to be  his teachers.

Zhenya kept on winning. Omar  Asaf got angrier and angrier.

Tell me whose dog it is. Why,\\nthe collar alone is worth hundreds of roubles.\" She thought the stones were just coloured glass. Hottabych became very\\nangry. He was both  angry and hurt. He wanted this noble, but naive woman to\\nunderstand that Has-san Abdurrakhman ibn Hottab was not one to  present  his\\nbest friends  with cheap imitations and that this truly priceless collar was\\nworth thousands upon thousands of roubles.

       "  ('The thin ribbon\\nof the Suez Canal separated it from the no  less yellow sands of the Arabian\\nDesert, which was  Africa, Egypt. Hottabych  had planned to begin his search\\nfor  Omar Asaf here, in the  Mediterranean, from  its eastern  point  to its\\nwestern  end. But no  sooner had the \"VK-1\" descended  to an altitude of 200\\nmetres,  than  Hottabych   groaned  and  said   he  was  an  old  fool. The\\nmagic-carpet-seaplane  gained altitude  and  headed west. After  spending so\\nmany years in  the  vessel,  Hottabych had forgotten that this was where the\\nNile discharged into the Mediterranean and where the water was  always muddy\\nfrom  the  slime and sand the great river carried far out to  sea. How could\\none even attempt a search in such sticky yellow mire? It would only irritate\\nthe eyes. Hottabych decided to put off the exploration of this inconvenient  area\\ntill last, if their search for Omar Asaf in other parts of the Mediterranean\\nproved futile. A short while later they landed  in  a quiet  blue lagoon close to  the\\nItalian city of Genoa. HOTTABYCH IS LOST AND FOUND AGAIN\\n\\n\\n     \"Well,  wish me luck!\" Hottabych  exclaimed, turning into  a fish  and\\ndisappearing into the lagoon. The  water  was  crystal-clear,  so very unlike the water  of the  Nile\\nDelta, and they  had a good view of the old  man working his fins quickly as\\nhe headed for the open sea. While awaiting his return, the boys went in for a good dozen dips, they\\ndived  to their heart\\'s content, lay in the sun  until they were dizzy, and,\\nfinally,  with  hunger  clawing  at  their insides,  they  began  to  worry. Hottabych had been gone for a suspiciously long time, though he had promised\\nnot  to be  away longer than an hour. The sun had long since set, colouring\\nthe horizon and the calm sea in tints of amazing beauty;  thousands  of city\\nlights twinkled in the distance, but still the old man had not returned. \"Could he have got lost?\" Zhenya said despondently. \"He can\\'t get lost,\" Volka answered. \"Chaps like him never get lost.\" \"He might have been swallowed by a shark.\" \"There aren\\'t any sharks in these  waters,\"  Volka objected, though  he\\nwasn\\'t too sure of his words. \"I\\'m hungry!\" Zhenya confessed after a long silence. Just then, a  rowboat nosed  into the  beach with  a soft splash. Three\\nfishermen climbed out. One  of them began to  lay a fire of driftwood, while\\nthe others picked out the smaller fish. They cleaned it  and threw it into a\\nkettle of water. \"Let\\'s go ask  them for something to eat,\" Zhenya suggested. \"They look\\nlike nice working people. I\\'m sure they\\'ll give us something.\" Volka agreed. \"Good evening, Signores!\" Zhenya  bowed politely,  as he  addressed the\\nfishermen. \"Just think  how many homeless children there  are  in our poor Italy!\" one of the three, a  thin,  grey-haired  man, said hoarsely. \"Giovanni, give\\nthem something to eat.\" \"We\\'ve just  enough  bread  for ourselves, but there\\'s plenty of onions\\nand  more than  enough salt!\" a curly-haired stocky youth of about  nineteen\\nanswered cheerfully. He was busy cleaning fish. \"Sit down, boys.',\n",

A famous Uzbek  cotton-grower\\ndanced to an accompaniment provided by Zhenya. There really should have been\\na  tambourine, but since  there was none, Zhenya tapped out the rhythm quite\\nwell on an enamelled tray. Everyone was pleased except the Uzbek, but he was\\nvery polite  and praised Zhenya, too. Then a young man from a Moscow factory\\nbegan doing card tricks. This time everyone except  Hottabych thought it was\\ngrand. He called Volka out into the corridor. \"Permit me, 0 Volka, to entertain these kind people with several simple\\nmiracles.\" Volka recalled  how  these \"simple  miracles\"  had nearly ended  in the\\ncircus and protested vigorously, \"Don\\'t even think of it!\" Finally, however,\\nhe agreed, because Hottabych was looking at him with such sad-dog eyes. \"All right,  but remember-just card tricks and maybe something with the\\nping-pong balls, if you want to.\" \"I shall never forget your wise generosity,\" Hottabych said gratefully,\\nand they returned to the  lounge. The  young  worker was in the midst  of  a\\nreally good trick. He offered anyone in the audience to choose a card, look\\nat it, replace  it, and then shuffle the  deck. Then he shuffled it too, and\\nthe top card always turned out to be the right one. After he had  received  his well-earned  applause and  returned  to his\\nseat,  Hottabych asked to  be  permitted  to  entertain the  gathering  with\\nseveral simple tricks. That\\'s how the boastful old man put it-simple. Naturally, everyone agreed. They applauded before he even began. Bowing  smartly to all sides like an old-timer on the stage,  Hottabych\\ntook two ping-pong balls from a table and threw them into the air. Suddenly,\\nthere were four balls; he  threw  them up again  and they became eight, then\\nthirty-two. He  began  juggling  all  thirty-two   balls,   and  then  they\\ndisappeared  and were found to be in thirty-two pockets of thirty-two people\\nin the audience. Then they flew out of the pockets, formed a chain and began\\nspinning around  a bowing Hottabych like sputniks until  they became a white\\nhoop. Hottabych put this large hoop  on Varvara Stepanovna\\'s lap with a  low\\nbow. The hoop began to flatten out  until it turned into a roll of excellent\\nsilk. Hottabych  cut it  into pieces with Volka\\'s  pen-knife. The pieces  of\\nsilk flew into  the  air  like birds and  wound themselves  into turbans  of\\nremarkable beauty around the heads of the amazed audience. Hottabych  listened to  the applause  blissfully. Then  he snapped his\\nfingers. The turbans  turned into  pigeons which flew out  through the  open\\nport-holes and  disappeared. Everyone was now convinced that  the old man in\\nthe funny oriental slippers was one of the greatest conjurors. Hottabych wallowed  in the  applause. The  boys knew him well enough to\\nunderstand how dangerous such unanimous and exciting approval was for him. \"Just wait  and see!',\n",

Tell me, for I know  of no  such\\nmeasurement.\" \"Let\\'s  see now. How can  I  explain?... Well, a  kilometre  is about a\\nthousand four hundred steps.\" \"Your steps? That means  there  are no more than a thousand two hundred\\nof my steps in a kilometre. Maybe even less.\" Omar  Asaf had an exaggerated idea about his  height. He was no  taller\\nthan Volka, but they could not convince him of this. \"Be  sure not  to crash  into  the  cupola of the  Heavens,\"  Hottabych\\nadmonished his  brother, not being completely convinced of  Volka\\'s  stories\\nabout the structure of the Universe. \"Don\\'t teach someone who  knows  more than you,\" Omar  Asaf said coldly\\nand soared into the air. He instantly  became white hot and disappeared from\\nview, leaving a long fiery trail behind. \"Let\\'s wait for him here, my friends,\" Hottabych suggested timidly, for\\nhe felt guilty for all the unpleasantness Omar Asaf had caused them. \"No, there\\'s no use waiting  for him now. You\\'ll never see him  again,\"\\nVolka said. \"He  didn\\'t listen to  my advice, which was  based on scientific\\nknowledge, and he\\'ll never return  to the Earth. Since your Omar took off at\\na speed which was  less  than eleven kilometres a  second, he\\'ll be circling\\nthe Earth forever. If you want to know, he\\'s become a sputnik.\" \"If you have no objections, I\\'ll wait for him here a while,\" a saddened\\nHottabych whispered. Late that night he slipped into Volka\\'s room. Turning into a  goldfish,\\nhe  dived silently  into  the  aquarium. Whenever  Hottabych  was upset  by\\nanything, he spent the night in the  aquarium  instead of under Volka\\'s bed. This  time he  was especially upset. He had waited for his brother for over\\nfive hours, but Omar Asaf had not returned.

He merely nodded  understandingly  to Volka,  who was\\nwinking hard from behind Hottabych\\'s back. Pressing his  right  hand to his  heart, the drilling foreman  answered\\nHottabych politely, \"Of course, my good  man, of course. But you\\'re so well\\npreserved. Let\\'s  go and  warm  up.

All his many years\\' experience rose up\\nagainst  the fact that  the  owner of the palace should invite a strange old\\nman and two young boys-all dressed in a far from elaborate  fashion-to share\\nhis meal. That meant there was  some mischief to  be  expected. Perhaps this\\nJafar Alt  ibn Mohammed was trying to coax them into his  palace in order to\\nplay a joke on them and then, having had his fill  of torturing  them, would\\norder  his servants to  chop off their heads, or throw them into  cages with\\nwild beasts. Oh, how cautious he had to be! So thought Hottabych  as he and his young  friends ascended  the  broad\\nstairway to the first block of dormitories. They encountered no  one, either on the stairs or in the hall, and this\\nbut served to confirm  Hottabych\\'s suspicions. Muhammedov  took them to his\\nroom, induced the  old  man to  change into  a  pair of pyjamas,  and  left,\\ntelling them to make themselves at  home. \"I\\'ll be back soon, after I give a\\nfew orders. I\\'ll be right back.\" \"Aha! We  know to whom you\\'ll give those  orders  and what they\\'ll  be\\nabout, you crafty, two-faced ruler!\" Hottabych thought. \"You have a heart of\\nstone, one that is immune to mercy. To chop off such noble boys\\' heads!\" Meanwhile, the noble boys were looking round the comfortable room. \"Look, d\\'you see this?\" Volka cried happily. He picked up a small table\\nfan, a thing Hottabych had never seen. \"It\\'s a fan,\" Volka explained. \"We\\'ll dry your beard in a flash!\" True enough, in two minutes\\' time Hottabych\\'s beard was ready for use. \"We\\'ll test it,\" the sly old man mumbled innocently. He  yanked out two hairs. Before the  crystal  tinkling  sound had died\\ndown,  our friends suddenly found  themselves about three miles away, on the\\nwarm  sandy  beach. At their feet, the blue-black waves  of the rising tide\\nsoftly lapped against the shore. \"This is much better,\"  Hottabych  said  contentedly. Before  the  boys\\ncould utter a sound, he yanked three more hairs from his beard. That very instant  a  large tray of  steaming roast lamb  and a second,\\nsmaller tray of fruit and biscuits appeared on the sand.

HOTTABYCH\\'S NEW YEAR VISIT\\n\\n     During the  winter vacation,  Zhenya went  to  visit his  relatives  in\\nZvenigorod. On January  4th he  received a letter,  which  was  of  extreme\\ninterest for at least three reasons. In the first place,  this was the first\\nletter he had ever received in which he was addressed by his full name, as a\\ngrown  man. In the second place, it was the first letter Hottabych  had ever\\nwritten to his young  friend. But  of greatest interest were the contents of\\nthis most remarkable message. Following is the letter, slightly abridged:\\n     \"0 most  lovable  and precious friend, the sweet and singular adornment\\nof  all  schools  and sports fields, the fond  hope of your native  arts and\\nsciences, the joy  and pride of your parents and friends,  Zhenya ibn Kolya,\\nfrom the famous and noble family of Bogorads, may your life\\'s road be strewn\\nwith  thornless  roses  and  may  it  be  as  long  as  your  pupil,  Hassan\\nAbdurrakhman ibn Hottab, wishes it to be! \"I  hope you  remember how great  my  joy and  gratitude were when, six\\nmonths  ago, you, 0 my young friend and friend of my young saviour, released\\nmy unfortunate brother Omar Asaf ibn  Hottab, from whom I  was so grievously\\nseparated for many centuries,  from his  horrible imprisonment in the copper\\nvessel. \"But  immediately following my first  joy  of  a  long-awaited reunion,\\nthere  came a  terrible disappointment, for my brother  turned out to  be an\\nungrateful,  short-sighted, narrow-minded, grouchy and  envious  person. And\\nhe, as you  well remember, took it upon himself to fly to the Moon, in order\\nto be convinced whether its surface was truly covered with mountains, as our\\nhighly educated friend  Volka ibn Alyosha stated, basing his knowledge on  a\\nscience called Astronomy. \"Alas! It was not a selfless thirst for knowledge that guided my unwise\\nbrother, nor the  noble and  exemplary desire  to discover the World,  but a\\nvain and ignorant wish to belittle and shame a person  who had tried to hold\\nhim back from committing a fatal deed. \"He  did not even take into account  the laws of another science called\\n\\'Mechanics,\\' and thereby doomed himself to  an eternal and useless  circling\\nof the Earth, which, as I  recently discovered (who could have ever  dreamed\\nof it!) in turn revolves around the Sun! \"Three days  ago  I received a message from you,  0  Zhenya  ibn Kolya,\\nwhich  bears  the  scientific  name  of  \\'Telegram,\\'  and  in  which you  so\\ngraciously  and pleasantly  wished me a Happy New Year.

There  was no glass  on it and instead of hands there was a\\nsmall vertical gold rod in the middle. The face was  studded  with  the most\\nexquisite emeralds set where the numbers should be. \"Never before did anyone, even the  wealthiest  of all  sultans, have a\\nhand  sun  watch!\" the old man boasted again. \"There were sun dials in  city\\nsquares, in market places, in gardens and in  yards. And they were all made\\nof stone. But I just invented this one. It\\'s not bad, is it?\" It certainly was exciting to be the only owner  of  a sun  watch in the\\nwhole world. Volka grinned broadly, while the old man beamed. \"How do you tell the time on it?\" Volka asked. \"Here\\'s how,\" Hottabych said, taking hold of Volka\\'s hand gently. \"Hold\\nyour arm  straight out like this and the shadow cast by  the little gold rod\\nwill fall on the right number.\" \"But the sun has to be  shining,\" Volka said, looking with  displeasure\\nat a small cloud that just obscured it. \"The cloud will pass in a minute,\" Hottabych promised. True enough, in\\na  minute  the sun began to shine  once  again. \"See, it  points  somewheres\\nbetween  2 and 3  p.m.  That means it\\'s about  2:30.\" As  he was  speaking,\\nanother cloud covered the sun. \"Don\\'t pay any attention  to  it,\"  Hottabych said. \"I\\'ll clear the sky\\nfor you whenever you want to find out what time it is.\" \"What about the autumn?\" Volka asked. \"What about it?\" \"What  about the autumn and the  winter, when the sky  is covered  with\\nclouds for months on end?\" \"I\\'ve already  told  you, 0 Volka, the sun will shine whenever you want\\nit to. You have but to order me and everything will be as you wish.\" \"But what if you\\'re not around?\" \"I\\'ll always be near-by.

He had  to control himself not to  teach\\nthe  insolent youth a good lesson. \"All right then, tell me whether you like\\nthat man\\'s watch. If you do, you shall have it.\" \"What  do you  mean?

Upon my word of honour, I have a wonderful idea!\" At  this, he went under, as in his excitement he could think of nothing\\nbetter to do than clap  his hands. He bobbed  up again, huffing and spitting\\nwater, and  then resumed his comfortable position on his back, continuing as\\nif nothing had happened:\\n     \"We have to  modernize the magic carpet:  it should  be streamlined and\\ncold-resistant, and it should have bunks and be on pontoons.\" It  was  most difficult  to explain Volka\\'s  idea  to Hottabych. In the\\nfirst place,  the  old man  did  not know what  \"streamlined\" meant. In the\\nsecond place, he could not visualize a pair of pontoons. It would seem that \"streamlined\" was such  a  simple word, but they had\\nto explain and explain  until  they finally  hit upon the  thought of saying\\nthat a streamlined magic carpet should look like a hollowed-out cucumber. It\\nalso  took  a great deal of  explaining to  make  Hottabych  understand what\\npontoons  were  like. Finally,  a  streamlined \"VK-1\"  magic-carpet-seaplane\\nsoared into the  air and set its course at  South-South-West. In translation\\nto ordinary words, \"VK-1\" meant \"Vladimir Kostylkov. First Model.\" This magic-carpet-seaplane, resembling a huge cucumber with a tiny stem\\nin  back, had  three berths  and two windows  on each  side, cut through the\\nheavy carpeting. The flying  qualities  of  Volka\\'s plane were  immeasurably superior to\\nthose  of  an ordinary  magic  carpet.

Omar Asaf was as quiet as  a mouse. Not once did he leave the cabin. He\\ncrept back into  the copper vessel without a murmur when the \"Ladoga\" docked\\nto  the strains of a band  at its home  pier, from which it had sailed  away\\nthirty days before.

At  any  rate,  their relatives and friends accepted it as a  matter of\\ncourse that  the children had been in the Arctic, without questioning how in\\nthe world they had ever booked berths on the Ladoga.\" After an  excellent dinner, the children told their  respective parents\\nthe story  of their adventures in  the  Arctic, keeping  almost true to  the\\nfacts.

He was a good and true friend.\" Then the  third fisherman entered  the  conversation. He  was a man  of\\nthirty, and his name was Cristoforo. \"What  about  Luigi? We should  give  him some  money,  too. The poor\\nfellow\\'s dying of tuberculosis.\" \"That\\'s right,\" Giovanni said. \"And Sybilla Capelli. Her son\\'s been in\\nprison for over a year now for organizing the strike.\" \"Just  think how many people we can help,\" Giovanni said excitedly. And\\nthe three  kind fishermen sat late into the night, discussing whom else they\\ncould help, now that they had the wonderful suitcases. These were honest and\\nkind-hearted  toilers,  and the  idea  never  entered  their  minds  to  use\\nHottabych\\'s present in order to get rich and be wealthy fishmongers.

THE VESSEL FROM THE PILLARS OF HERCULES\\n\\n\\n     This time Hottabych was true to  his word. He had promised he\\'d be back\\nin two or three hours. At about a quarter to nine his beaming face shot out\\nof the  water. The old  man  was  excited. He scrambled up  on  the  beach,\\ncarrying a large seaweed-covered metal object over his head. \"I found him, my friends!\" he yelled. \"I found the vessel in which  my\\nunfortunate  brother  Omar Asaf ibn  Hottab has  been  imprisoned these many\\ncenturies-may the sun always shine over him!

Gradually, however,  he got used to his absence  and once again\\neverything was back to normal. One day he and the boys were talking quietly. It was still rather early\\nand the old man was lolling under the bed. \"It looks like rain,\" Zhenya said, looking out the window. Soon the whole sky became overcast with clouds. It started to drizzle. \"Shall we turn it on?\" Volka asked off-handedly,  nodding towards a new\\nradio set his parents  had given him for being  promoted to 7B. He turned it\\non with obvious pleasure. The  loud  sounds of  a symphony  orchestra filled the room. Hottabych\\nstuck his head out from under the bed. \"Where are all those people playing so sweetly on various instruments?\" \"Golly! Hottabych doesn\\'t know anything about radios!\" Zhenya said. (There  was  one  omission  on  the  \"Ladoga\"  for  all  its  excellent\\nequipment-they forgot to install a radio set in the lounge.) For nearly two  hours  the  boys watched Hottabych delightedly. The old\\nman  was  overwhelmed. Volka  tuned  in  on  Vladivostok,  Tbilisi,   Kiev,\\nLeningrad, Minsk and Tashkent. Songs, thunderous marches, and the  voices of\\npeople speaking in many tongues  obediently poured forth from the set. Then\\nthe boys  got fed up. The  sun peeped out and they decided to go for a walk,\\nleaving  a  fascinated  Hottabych behind. The  strange  events  which  then\\noccurred remain a mystery to Volka\\'s grandmother to this very day. Soon  after the boys left,  she entered  Volka\\'s  room to turn off  the\\nradio and distinctly  heard an old man  coughing in the empty room. Then she\\nsaw the dial turn by itself and the indicator move along the scale. The  frightened  old  woman  decided  not to touch the set, but to find\\nVolka immediately. She caught up with  him at the  bus stop. Volka was very\\nupset. He said he  was  improving the set, that he was  making it automatic,\\nand  he begged his grandmother not to tell his  parents what she  had  seen,\\nbecause it was supposed to be a  surprise for them. His grandmother was  not\\nat all  comforted by  these words. Nevertheless,  she promised  to keep his\\nsecret.

I  don\\'t want you  to worry about\\nanything,\" Volka said comfortingly and ran off. Gathered on  the spardeck near  the  captain\\'s bridge were about twenty\\nhalf-dressed passengers. They were  all discussing  something  quietly. In\\norder to raise  their spirits, Volka assumed a cheerful, carefree expression\\nand said courageously:\\n     \"Be calm, everyone!

Besides,  it\\nwas rather chilly on deck and he decided to run down and get his coat. \"Calmness above all!\" he said  to Hottabych, who was  waiting  for  him\\nbelow. \"There\\'s no reason to get panicky. Before two days  are out, a giant\\nice-breaker will  come  for  us and  set us afloat once  again. We certainly\\ncould  have done it ourselves, but  can you hear? The engines  have stopped\\nworking. Something went wrong,  but no one can find out  what  it is. There\\nwill surely be deprivations, but let\\'s hope that no one will die.\" Volka was listening to himself speak with pleasure. He had never dreamt\\nhe could calm people so easily and convincingly. \"0  woe is me!\" the old  man cried suddenly, shoving his bare feet into\\nhis  famous  slippers. \"If you perish, I\\'ll not survive  you.

You ordered\\nthe engines to be still, but they  can\\'t work silently. That\\'s why the ship\\nstopped so suddenly. Take back your order before the boilers explode!\" \"I hear and I obey,\" a rather frightened Hottabych answered shakily. That  very moment  the  engines began  to hum  again and  the  \"Ladoga\"\\ncontinued on its way as  before. Meanwhile, the captain, the chief  engineer\\nand everyone else  on board were  at  a loss to explain why  the engines had\\nstopped so  suddenly and mysteriously and had resumed  working again just as\\nsuddenly and mysteriously. Only  Hottabych and  Volka  knew what  had  happened,  but  for obvious\\nreasons  they said nothing. Not even to Zhenya. But then, Zhenya  had slept\\nsoundly through it all. \"If  there was ever  an international contest to see who\\'s the soundest\\nsleeper,  I bet  Zhenya would  get  first prize and be  the world champion,\"\\nVolka said.',\n",

The  applause which\\nfollowed was so deafening, the whole scene might very well have taken  place\\nat a weight-lifting contest and not on board a ship in danger. \"I  take  my words back,\" the captain said  solemnly after the applause\\nhad died down. \"And now, let\\'s get to work!

Then we\\'ll certainly drown  in no\\ntime.\" \"Think again, Hottabych! Maybe you\\'ll think of some thing!\" \"I\\'ll try my best, 0  compass of my soul,\" the old man replied. After a\\nshort pause he asked, \"What if I make the rocks disappear?\" \"Oh, Hottabych! How smart you are!\" Volka said  and  began to shake his\\nhand. \"That\\'s a wonderful idea.\" \"I hear and I obey.\" The first emergency  team was down in the hold, loading  the first iron\\nbins with coal, when  the \"Ladoga\"  suddenly lurched and then began  to spin\\naround in a  whirlpool over the  spot where there had just  been a shoal. In\\nanother  minute,  the  ship would  have broken to bits, had  not Volka sense\\nenough to tell  Hottabych to  make  the  whirlpool disappear. The sea became\\ncalm; the \"Ladoga\" spun  around a while longer from  sheer force of inertia. Then it continued on its way. Once again, no one but Hottabych and Volka knew what he happened. Ahead were more exciting days, each unlike the other, as they journeyed\\nacross  little-known  seas  and channels, past bleak  islands  upon which no\\nhuman foot had ever stepped. The passengers often left the ship to go ashore\\non  deserted cliffs  and  on  islands where polar station teams greeted them\\nwith  rifle salvos. Our three friends joined the rest in climbing  glaciers,\\nwandering over the naked stones of basalt plateaux, jumping from ice-floe to\\nice-floe  over black  open  patches  of water, and  hunting polar bears. The\\nfearless Hottabych dragged one bear aboard the \"Ladoga\" by the scruff of its\\nneck. Under his  influence the  animal soon became  as tame and playful as a\\ncat, and so provided many happy hours for both  passengers and crew.

After Volka\\'s explanation, Hottabych began to  follow the course of the\\nmatch with ever-increasing interest.

Ten minutes later a tired barber stuck his\\nhead into the waiting room and shouted:\\n     \"Next!\" Then, from a corner  near  the coat-rack, rose  a  boy whose  face  was\\nwrapped in an expensive silk scarf. He  hurriedly sat  down in the barber\\'s\\nchair. \"You  want  a  hair-cut?\" the  barber  asked. \"No,  a shave!\" the boy\\nanswered  in a hollow voice and removed the scarf  that had  covered most of\\nhis face.

In  order  to  harden  the  old man\\'s  nerves, they crossed the busiest\\nstreets at least  twenty times. Then they  rode on a trolley-car  for a long\\nwhile and, finally, tired but content, they boarded a bus. They rode off, bouncing softly on the leather-upholstered seats. Volka  was engrossed  in  a copy  of Pionerskaya Pravda, the children\\'s\\nnewspaper. The  old man was lost in thought and kept  glancing at  his young\\ncompanion  kindly from time  to time. Then his face  broke  into  a  smile,\\nevidently reflecting some pleasant idea he had conceived. The bus took them to the doorstep. Soon they were back in Volka\\'s room. \"Do  you  know  what, 0 most  honourable of  secondary school  pupils?\" Hottabych began the minute the door closed  behind them. \"I think you should\\nbe more  aloof and reserved in your relations  with the young inhabitants of\\nyour house. Believe it or not, my heart was ready to break when I heard them\\nshouting:\\n     \\'Hey, Volka!\\' \\'Hello, Volka!\\' and so forth, all  of which  is obviously\\nunworthy  of you. Forgive me for being so outspoken, 0 blessed one,  but you\\nhave slackened the reins unnecessarily. How can they be your equals when you\\nare  the richest  of  the  rich,  to  say nothing of  your other innumerable\\nqualities?\" \"Huh! They certainly are my equals. One boy is  even  a grade ahead  of\\nme, and we\\'re all equally rich.\" \"No, you  are mistaken here, 0  treasure of my  soul!\" Hottabych cried\\ndelightedly and led  Volka to the  window. \"Look, and be  convinced of  the\\ntruth of my words.\" A strange sight met Volka\\'s eyes. A few moments before, the left half of their tremendous  yard  had been\\noccupied  by a volley-ball pitch, a big pile of fresh sand for the toddlers,\\n\"giant steps\" and  swings  for  the  daring,  exercise  bars  and rings  for\\nathletics fans,  and one long and  two round bright flower-beds  for all the\\ninhabitants to enjoy.',\n",

The elephants, and  the camels, and the mules, and all the\\ngold  and  precious stones they carry,  and the  people who are accompanying\\nthem-everything is yours!\" Things were going from bad  to worse. Volka had nearly become the owner\\nof three magnificent but quite  useless palaces, and  now  he was to  be the\\nowner  of  a  vast fortune,  an  owner  of  elephants and, to  top  it all-a\\nslave-owner! His first thought was to  beg Hottabych to make all these useless gifts\\ndisappear before anyone had noticed them. But  he immediately  recalled how\\nthings had gone with the palaces. If he had been smarter, he  probably would\\nhave been able to talk the old man into letting the city keep them. He had to stall for time to think and map out a plan of action. \"You know what, Hottabych?\" he said, trying to  sound nonchalant. \"What\\ndo  you say if we go for a ride  on a camel, while the men take  care of the\\ncaravan?\" \"It would really be a pleasure,\" answered the unsuspecting old man. A moment later,  a double-humped camel appeared on the  street, swaying\\nmajestically and looking round  with  an arrogant air. On  its  back were an\\nexcited Volka and Hottabych, who felt quite at home and was fanning  himself\\nlazily with his hat. \"A camel! A camel!\" the children shouted excitedly. They had poured out\\ninto the street in great numbers, just  as if they had all  been waiting for\\nthe camel to appear. They surrounded the  unruffled animal in a close circle, and it towered\\nover them like a double-decker bus towers over an ice-cream cart. One of the\\nlittle boys was skipping and shouting:\\n\\n     They\\'re coming\\n     on a camel! They\\'re coming\\n     on a camel! The camel  approached the crossing  just as the light turned red. Since\\nit was not used  to traffic  rules, it coolly stepped across the  white line\\nwith the word \"STOP!\" written in large letters in front of it. In vain did\\nVolka try to hold it back. The camel  continued on its way, straight towards\\nthe militia man who was quickly pulling out his receipt book for fines. Suddenly a horn blared, brakes screeched and a light blue car came to a\\nstop  right under the steely-nerved camel\\'s nose. The driver jumped out  and\\nbegan yelling at the animal  and its two passengers. And  true  enough,  in\\nanother second there would have been a terrible accident. \"Kindly pull over to the  curb,\" the militia man  said politely  as  he\\nwalked up to them. Volka had great difficulty in making the camel obey this fatal order. A\\ncrowd gathered immediately, and everyone had an opinion to offer:\\n     \"This is the first time I\\'ve seen people riding a camel in Moscow.\" \"Just think, there could have been a terrible accident!\" \"What\\'s wrong with a child going for a ride on a camel?\"',\n",

Shaken by this  impossible occurrence, the doorman gulped down the  tea\\nintended for Hottabych, poured  himself a second cup, and then a  third, and\\ndid not stop until there wasn\\'t a drop left. Then he sank into his chair and\\nbegan to fan himself exhaustedly with his newspaper. All the while, a  no less unusual scene  was taking place on the second\\nfloor, right above the doorman, in the classroom of 6B. The teachers, headed\\nby  the principal, Pavel Vasilyevich,  sat at  a  table covered with a heavy\\ncloth used for  special occasions. Behind them was the blackboard, hung with\\nvarious maps. Facing them were rows of solemn pupils. It was so quiet in the\\nroom that one could hear a lonely fly buzzing monotonously near the ceiling. If the pupils of  6B were always this quiet, theirs would undoubtedly be the\\nmost disciplined class in all of Moscow. It must be noted, however, that the quiet in the classroom was not only\\ndue to the  hush accompanying  any examination,  but also to the  fact  that\\nVolka Kostylkov had been called to the board-and he was not in the room. \"Vladimir  Kostylkov!\" the principal repeated  and looked at  the quiet\\nchildren in surprise. It became still more quiet. Then, suddenly, they heard the loud clatter of running feet in the hall\\noutside, and at  the very  moment  the principal called \"Vladimir Kostylkov\"\\nfor the third and last time, the door burst open and Volka, very much out of\\nbreath, gasped:\\n     \"Here!\" \"Please come up to the board,\" the principal  said dryly. \"We\\'ll  speak\\nabout your being late afterwards.\" \"I  ... I feel ill,\" Volka mumbled, saying the first thing that came to\\nhis head, as he walked uncertainly towards his examiners.

He had an absorbed look on his face. Volka finally took the first slip his hand touched. Tempting his fate,\\nhe turned it over  very slowly, but was pleasantly surprised to see  that he\\nwas to  speak on India. He knew quite a lot about India, since he had always\\nbeen interested in that country. \"Well, let\\'s hear what you have to say,\" the principal said.

Volka suggested that they rise another 500 elbows or so. \"Then we\\'ll\\nsee the sun again.\" Hottabych greatly doubted that they could see the sun  before  morning,\\nsince it had already set, but he didn\\'t argue. You can imagine how surprised he was and how his esteem for Volka grew,\\nwhen,  as they rose higher, they really saw the sun again! For a second time\\nits crimson edge was barely touching the black line of the far horizon. \"Oh, Volka, if only I had not promised  myself faithfully  to obey your\\nmodest request, nothing would prevent  me from calling you the greatest dope\\nin  the world,\" Hottabych  cried  ecstatically.

A guilty Hottabych only grunted in reply. \"He\\'s all alone in  a  strange land, without any  friends or relatives. The poor fellow\\'s probably groaning,\" Volka continued sadly. Hottabych again said nothing. If only our  travellers could have heard what  was  happening that very\\nminute, thousands of miles away to the East!

They went\\nback to their homes in amazement. Volka  gulped down his supper, undressed and climbed  into  bed with  a\\nhappy sigh. He only had a sheet for a cover, since it was so hot. Hottabych, however, had decided to comply with an ancient custom Genies\\nhad. He  became  invisible and lay down  across the threshold, to guard his\\nyoung  master\\'s  sleep.

He\\ndashed into his room, nearly breaking his leg as he stumbled on a chandelier\\nlying on the  floor. It was Grandma\\'s famous  chandelier. Very  long  ago,\\nbefore the Revolution, his deceased  grandfather had  converted  it  from  a\\nhanging oil lamp.

Since it was not  elegant\\nenough to  be hung in  the  dining room, they decided to hang it in  Volka\\'s\\nroom. That is why a huge iron hook had been screwed into the ceiling. Volka rubbed his sore knee, locked the door, took his penknife from his\\npocket and, trembling from excitement, scraped the seal off the bottle.

It was the ring with the inscription: \"Wear\\nit, Katya, and remember me,\" which Mr. Moneybags must have lost as he rolled\\naway. The  old  man  picked  it  up,  wiped  it  with  his huge,  bright-blue\\nhandkerchief, and put it on his right small finger.

EXTRA TICKETS\\n\\n\\n     On a bright and sunny summer day our friends set out  to see a football\\ngame. During the soccer season  the entire  population  of Moscow is divided\\ninto two alien  camps. In the one are the football  fans; in the other  are\\nthose queer people who are entirely indifferent to this fascinating sport. Long before the beginning of the game, these  first stream  towards the\\nhigh entrance gates of the Central Stadium from all parts of the city. They  look upon those who are heading in  the opposite direction with a\\nfeeling of superiority. In  turn,  these  other  Muscovites shrug in  amazement when  they  see\\nhundreds of crowded buses  and trolley-buses and thousands  of cars crawling\\nthrough the turbulent sea of pedestrian fans. But  the  army  of  fans  which  appears  so unified  to an onlooker is\\nactually torn into two camps. This is unnoticeable while the fans are making\\ntheir way to the stadium. However, as they approach the gates, this division\\nappears  in  all its ugliness. It suddenly becomes  evident that some people\\nhave tickets,  while others do  not. The possessors  of tickets pass through\\nthe gates  confidently; the others dart back and forth excitedly, rushing at\\nnew arrivals with the same plaintive plea: \"D\\'you  have an extra ticket?\" or\\n\"You don\\'t have an extra ticket, do you?\" As a rule, there are so few extra tickets and so many people in need of\\nthem, that if  not for Hottabych, Volka and Zhenya would have certainly been\\nleft outside the gates. \"With the greatest of pleasure,\" Hottabych murmured in reply to Volka\\'s\\nrequest. \"You\\'ll have as many as you need in a minute.\" No sooner were  these words  out of  his  mouth, than the boy  saw  him\\nholding  a whole  sheaf  of blue, green  and yellow  tickets. \"Will  this be\\nenough, 0  wonderful Volka? If not,  I\\'ll....\" He  waved the tickets. This\\ngesture  nearly cost him his  life. \"Look, extra  tickets!\" a  man  shouted,\\nmaking a dash for him.',\n",

I mean, it\\'s not hard for me to do at all,\" Hottabych\\nanswered in a barely audible whisper. \"I don\\'t think even you can do it,\" Volka said craftily. \"Yes, I can, but I feel very tired.\" \"See, that\\'s what I said! You can\\'t do it.\" At this, Hottabych rose up  with a sigh. He  yanked thirteen hairs from\\nhis beard, tore them to bits, and shouted a strange and very long word. Then\\nhe sank down onto the sawdust covering the floor. From high under the circus\\ntent enraptured people came whizzing  down, and each one to  his  own  seat. Sidorelli and his assistants, the props and the uniformed attendants, headed\\nby the imposing ring-master, appeared on the arena as from under the ground. Flapping  their  ears loudly, all seven African  elephants came  flying\\nback. They  landed and formed  a pyramid again, only this time the smallest\\none was on the bottom and the big one with the twinkling eyes on  top, right\\nunder  the roof. Then  the pyramid they  formed fell apart and  they  rushed\\naround the arena in single file, getting smaller and smaller until they were\\nno bigger than the head of a pin; finally, they got lost in the sawdust. The orchestra rolled out of Hottabych\\'s right ear like a pea;\\n     it mushroomed into a huge pile of laughing people and, contrary  to the\\nlaw of  gravity, rolled upwards to  the bandstand, where  it fell apart into\\nthirty-three men. They took their seats and began to play a march. \"Let  me  through,  please! Let  me  through!\" a thin  man  in  large\\nhorn-rimmed glasses  said, as he  made  his way  through  the excited  crowd\\nstanding around Hottabych. \"Won\\'t  you be  so  kind as to  drop in  at  the\\nmanager\\'s office?

First of all, there arises the question of where to keep him. You can\\'t\\nput  him  in a  hospital, and  there\\'s no question of  keeping him in bed at\\nhome, where everyone can see him. Then again, how does one cure a  Genie? Modern medicine  is useful when\\none deals with people, not fairy-tale magicians. And, finally, can people catch Genies\\' diseases? The boys discussed these problems at great length  as they rode home in\\na cab with a delirious Hottabych. They came to the following decisions:\\n     1.',\n",

The passengers were worn out from the mass of new impressions, from\\nthe  sun  which shone round the  clock from the frequent  fogs  and  endless\\ncrashing of ice against the stem and sides  of  the ship. At each stop there\\nwere  less and less passengers who  wished to go ashore on deserted islands,\\nand  towards the end of  the  journey  our friends  and two  or three  other\\ntireless explorers  were the only ones to take advantage o a chance to climb\\nthe inhospitable cliffs.

They could do it  in peace since Hottabych, who was usually in a rush to get\\nback, was staying behind to play chess with the captain. \"Volka,\" Zhenya said  mysteriously when they dragged their feet  aboard\\nthe \"Ladoga\" three hours  later. \"Come on down to  the cabin!

I found it on the opposite side of the island. Right near the water.\" Zhenya was holding a small copper vessel the size of a decanter. It was\\nall green from age and brine. \"We should give it  to the captain right away,\" Volka  said  excitedly. \"Some expedition probably put  a letter inside and threw it  into the water,\\nhoping someone would come to the rescue.\" \"That\\'s what I thought at first, too, but then I decided  nothing would\\nhappen if we opened it first to have a look  inside.

Under it was a heavy lead\\ncap covered with a seal. Zhenya had great difficulty prying it loose. \"And now we\\'ll see what\\'s inside,\" he said, turning it upside-down over\\nhis berth. Before he had  time to finish the sentence, clouds of black smoke began\\npouring from the bottle, filling the entire cabin. It became dark and choky. Presently, the  thick vapour condensed and became an unsightly  old man with\\nan angry face and a pair of eyes that burnt like coals.

The  carpet rose over the highest trees, over the highest houses,  over\\nthe highest factory stacks and sailed over the city that was blinking with a\\nmillion  lights  below. They  could hear muffled  voices, automobile  horns,\\npeople singing in row boats on the river and the far-off music of a band. The city  was plunged in twilight,  but here, high  up in the air, they\\ncould  still  see the  crimson  ball of  the sun  sinking  slowly beyond the\\nhorizon. \"I wonder how high up we are now?\" Volka said thoughtfully. \"About 600  or  700 elbows,\" Hottabych  answered,  still  figuring  out\\nsomething on his fingers. Meanwhile,  the  carpet settled on  its course,  though  still  gaining\\nheight. Hottabych sat down majestically, crossing his legs and holding on to\\nhis hat. Volka tried to sit down cross-legged, as  Hottabych  had, but found\\nneither pleasure nor satisfaction from this position. He shut his eyes tight\\nto  overcome his  awful dizziness and sat down on  the  edge  of the carpet,\\ndangling  his legs over the side. Though this was more comfortable, the wind\\ntore  at his  legs  mercilessly; it blew them  off  to a side  and they were\\nconstantly at a sharp angle to  his body. He soon became convinced that this\\nmethod was no good either, and finally settled down with his  legs stretched\\nout before him on the carpet. In  no  time, he felt chilled to the bone. He thought sadly of his warm\\njacket that was so far below in his closet at home, hundreds of miles away. As a last resort, he decided  to warm up the way  cabbies used to do in\\nthe olden days, long before he was born. His father  once showed him  how it\\nwas done when they were out ice  skating. Volka began to slap his shoulders\\nand sides in sweeping motions, and in the twinkling of an eye he slipped off\\nthe carpet and into nothingness. Needless  to say, if he had not  grabbed  on to the  fringes, our story\\nwould have ended with this unusual air accident. Hottabych did not even notice what had happened to his young friend. He\\nwas sitting  with  his back to  Volka, his legs tucked under  him in Eastern\\nfashion and lost in thought. He was trying to recall  how to break spells he\\nhimself had cast. \"Hottabych!\" Volka howled,  feeling that he  wouldn\\'t  last long, as he\\nhung on to the fringes. \"Help, Hottabych!\" \"0 woe is me!\" the  old man cried, seeing that Volka was flying through\\nthe air. \"Shame on  my old grey head! I would have killed myself if you had\\nperished!\" Muttering and calling himself all kinds of names for being so careless,\\nhe dragged a petrified Volka back up on the carpet, sat him down and put his\\narm around the boy, firmly resolved not to let go of him until they landed. \"It would be  g-g-good t-t-to h-h-have s-s-something w-w-warm to wear!\" Volka said wistfully through chattering teeth.',\n",

He turned it  and said in a\\nloud  voice, \"I want  a  bicycle right now!\" All three held their breaths in\\nexpectation. However, no bicycle appeared. Zhenya repeated  still louder, \"I want to  have a  bicycle immediately! This very minute!\" But the bicycle just wouldn\\'t appear. \"Something must have gone wrong with  the ring,\"  Volka said, taking it\\nfrom Zhenya  and looking  at  it closely. \"Look, there\\'s  something written\\ninside.

Tired from  all their experiences and lulled to sleep by  the  complete\\nquiet that  surrounded them, Hottabych and  Volka did not  notice  how  they\\ndozed off under the warm quilted robes that had appeared from nowheres. Volka had curled up cosily and  slept a dreamless sleep, but Hottabych,\\nwho  had  fallen  asleep  sitting  up uncomfortably, with his  chest pressed\\nagainst his sharp old knees, had a terrible dream. He  dreamt  that the servants  of  Sulayman, son of  David, led  by the\\nVizier Asaf ibn Barakhiya, were  once  again about to imprison him in a clay\\nvessel  and that they had stuffed him halfway in  already, but that  he  was\\nstruggling desperately, pressing  his chest against the mouth of the bottle.

Worst of all, someone had a firm  hold on\\nHottabych\\'s arms so that he was  unable to yank a single hair from his beard\\nand therefore was  unable to use his magic powers to save himself and Volka. Realizing that  it would be too late to  do anything in a few more  moments,\\nHottabych  exerted all his energy. In  great despair  he  plunged sideways,\\nforcefully enough to fall completely out of the vessel. Before really waking\\nup, he slipped off the carpet into the cold black void below. Fortunately, his  shout  awakened Volka. The boy was just able to  grab\\nhis  left arm. Now it was Hottabych\\'s turn to fly in  tow behind the carpet. However, the tow was not very  firm: the old man was  too  heavy  for Volka. They  would  probably  have plunged downwards  from this great height to the\\nunseen  Earth below, if Hottabych had  not managed  to yank a whole batch of\\nhair from his beard with his  free hand and rattle  off  the necessary magic\\nwords. Suddenly, Volka found he could pull the old man up quite easily. Our  young  fellow\\'s  happiness  would  have  been  complete,  had  not\\nHottabych been bellowing,  \"Aha, 0 Volka! Everything\\'s in  top  shape, 0 my\\nprecious one!\" and trying to sing something and laughing with such wild glee\\nall the while  Volka was pulling him  up that he really became worried: what\\nif  the old  man had  lost his mind from fright? True, once Hottabych  found\\nhimself on the carpet, he  stopped singing. Yet, he could think  of  nothing\\nbetter to do  than begin a jig. And this in  the  middle of  the night! On a\\nshabby, threadbare old magic carpet! \"Tra-la-la, 0 Volka! Tra-la-la, 0 ibn Alyosha!\" Hottabych yelled in the\\ndarkness, raising his  long skinny  legs  high and  constantly  running  the\\ndanger of falling off the carpet again.

It was quiet and  peaceful aboard the \"Ladoga.\" From every cabin  there\\ncame  the sound of snoring  or deep  breathing, as if  this  were not taking\\nplace on a ship some two and a  half thousand kilometres from  the mainland,\\nin the harsh and treacherous Barents  Sea, but in a cosy rest home somewhere\\nnear Moscow, during the afternoon \"quiet hour.\" The shades were drawn on the\\nport-holes, just  as on the  windows  in rest homes, to keep out  the bright\\nsunshine. SHIPWRECKED? However, it soon became clear that there was a very tangible difference\\nbetween the \"Ladoga\" and a rest  home. Apart  from  the Crimean earthquake,\\nold-timers at rest homes do not recall having  been tossed out of their beds\\nin  their sleep. The passengers had  just fallen  asleep when  a  sharp jerk\\nthrew them from their berths. That very  moment the steady hum of the engines stopped. In the silence\\nwhich  followed,  one could hear  the slamming  of  doors  and  the sound of\\nrunning feet, as the people rushed out of their cabins to  find out what had\\nhappened. There were shouts of command coming from the deck. Volka was lucky\\nin  tumbling  out  of the top berth without  major  injuries. He immediately\\njumped to  his feet and began to rub his sore  spots. As he was still  half\\nasleep, he  decided that it had been his own fault and was about to climb up\\nagain when  the murmur of  anxious voices coming from the corridor convinced\\nhim that the reason was much more serious than he thought. \"Perhaps we  hit  an underground  reef?\" he wondered,  pulling on  his\\nclothes. This thought,  far  from  frightening him, gave  him  a strange and\\nburning  feeling of  anxious exhilaration. \"Golly! This is a real adventure! Gee! There isn\\'t a single ship  within a thousand kilometres, and maybe  our\\nwireless doesn\\'t work!\" He imagined  a  most  exciting  picture:  they were  shipwrecked, their\\nsupplies of drinking  water  and  food  were  coming  to  an  end,  but  the\\npassengers  and  crew of  the  \"Ladoga\"  were calm  and courageous-as Soviet\\npeople should be. Naturally,  he,  Volka Kostylkov, had  the  greatest will\\npower. Yes,  Vladimir Kostylkov  could look  danger  in  the face. He would\\nalways be cheerful and outwardly carefree,  he would comfort those who  were\\ndespondent. When  the  captain of the \"Ladoga\" would succumb to the  inhuman\\nstrain and  deprivation, he, Volka,  would  rightly take over command of the\\nship.',\n",

Volka  marched  downstairs, solemnly carrying  the sofa pillows  to the\\nwaiting truck. \"Are you moving?\" a boy from next door asked. \"Yes,\" Volka answered  indifferently,  as though he was  used to moving\\nfrom one apartment to another every week and there  was nothing very special\\nabout it. The  janitor,  Stepanych,  walked over, slowly  rolled a  cigarette and\\nbegan  an  unhurried conversation as  one grown-up talk  to another. The boy\\nfelt dizzy with pride and happiness. He  gathered his  courage  and invited\\nStepanych  to  visit  them  at their  new  home. The  janitor  said,  \"With\\npleasure.\" A serious, important, man-to-man conversation was beginning, when\\nall at once Volka\\'s mother\\'s voice came through the open window:\\n     \"Volka! Volka! Where can that awful child be?\" Volka raced  up to  the\\nstrangely  large and empty apartment  in which shreds of old newspapers  and\\nold medicine bottles were lying forlornly about the floor. \"At last!\" his  mother said. \"Take your precious aquarium and get right\\ninto the truck. I want you to sit on the sofa and  hold the aquarium on your\\nlap. There\\'s no other place  for it. But be sure the water doesn\\'t splash on\\nthe sofa.\" It\\'s really strange, the way parents worry when they\\'re moving to a new\\napartment. THE STRANGE VESSEL\\n\\n\\n     Well,  the  truck  finally  choked  exhaustedly   and  stopped  at  the\\nattractive  entrance  of  Volka\\'s new  house. The  movers  quickly  carried\\neverything upstairs and soon were gone. Volka\\'s father opened a few  crates and said, \"We\\'ll do the rest in the\\nevening.\" Then he left for the factory. Mother  and  Grandma  began unpacking the  pots  and pans, while  Volka\\ndecided to run down to the river nearby. His father had warned him not to go\\nswimming without him, because the river was  very deep, but Volka soon found\\nan  excuse: \"I have to go in for a dip  to clear my head. How can  I take an\\nexam with a fuzzy brain!\" It\\'s  wonderful,  the way Volka  was always able to  think of an excuse\\nwhen he was about to do something he was not allowed to do. How convenient it  is to  have a river near your house! Volka told  his\\nmother he\\'d go sit on the bank and study his geography. And  he  really  and truly intended to spend about  ten minutes leafing\\nthrough  the text-book. However, he got undressed and jumped into the water\\nthe  minute he reached the river. It was  still  early, and there was not a\\nsoul on the bank. This had its good and bad points. It was nice,  because no\\none could  stop him  from swimming  as much as he liked. It was bad, because\\nthere  was no  one to admire  what  a good  swimmer and  especially  what an\\nextraordinary diver he was. Volka swam and dived until he became blue. Finally, he  realized he had\\nhad enough. He was ready to climb out when he suddenly changed  his mind and\\ndecided to dive into the clear water one last time.',\n",

ABOARD THE \"SWEET OMAR\"\\n\\n\\n     Had our friend the conductor on  the Moscow-Odessa express miraculously\\nfound himself aboard the twin-masted  \"Sweet Omar,\" he would  not have  been\\nmost amazed  at the fact that he had suddenly found himself aboard a sailing\\nvessel,  nor that  this vessel did  not in any way resemble  a  usual sea or\\nriver  craft. He  would have been most amazed at finding that he was already\\nacquainted with the passengers and crew. The  old man and his  two young  companions who had  left Compartment 7\\nthat morning were its passengers, while the four dark-skinned citizens whose\\nterm of service dated back to the 16th century B.C. were its crew. One  can  well  imagine  that a second encounter would have landed  the\\nimpressive conductor in bed for a long time. Despite  the fact  that  Volka  and  Zhenya  had become  accustomed  to\\nwitnessing  the  most unexpected events during the past few days,  they were\\nmost  amazed  to  find  their  recent acquaintances aboard the  ship and  to\\ndiscover that they were also excellent sailors. After the  boys had stood gazing at  the quick and skilful movements of\\nthe small crew scurrying up and down the riggings just as if  they were on a\\npolished floor, they went  to explore  the rest  of  the ship. It was  very\\nbeautiful,  but  small-no  larger  than  a  Moscow  river  launch. However,\\nHottabych assured  them that even Sulayman, the Son of David, did not have a\\nship as big as the \"Sweet Omar.\" Everything  on the ship glittered with cleanliness  and  splendour. Its\\nsides and high, carved  bow  and stern were inlaid with gold  and ivory. The\\npriceless  rosewood deck was covered with rugs as magnificent as those which\\nadorned the cabins. That is why Volka was so surprised at suddenly coming  upon a dark  and\\nfilthy cubby-hole in the prow. In it were plank beds covered with rags. As he looked in disgust at  the meagre  furnishings of this  tiny room,\\nZhenya joined him. After careful scrutiny, Zhenya decided the unsightly hole\\nwas intended for the pirates they might capture on the way. \"Not  at all,\" Volka persisted. \"This place was forgotten about after a\\ncomplete overhauling. Sometimes, after repairs,  there\\'s a forgotten  corner\\nfull of rags and all kinds of rubbish.\" \"What do  you  mean  by \\'a complete overhauling\\' when this ship  didn\\'t\\neven exist this morning?\" Zhenya protested. Volka had no answer  to this  question, and so the boys set off to find\\nHottabych,  to ask him to help solve the mystery. But they found the old man\\nasleep and thus  did not speak to him until an  hour or two later, at dinner\\ntime. Tucking their feet under them  uncomfortably, they sat down on a thick,\\nbrightly-coloured carpet. There were neither chairs nor tables in the cabin\\nor anywhere else on board.',\n",

Hottabych lay on the bottom of the aquarium, moving his fins sluggishly\\nand swallowing water lazily. When either Volka or Zhenya approached, the old\\nman would swim  off  to the far side and rudely turn  his tail towards them.

He apparently found  some bitter pleasure in the fact that Volka\\nkept pleading with him to get out of the water and stop sulking. The old man\\nwould listen to all his entreaties with his tail turned towards the boy. Yet\\nthe moment his young friend would open his geography book and begin to study\\nfor his exam, Hottabych would stick his head out of the aquarium and  accuse\\nVolka of having no heart at all.

He had\\ndecided to do his utmost to get an \"A.\" Despite his sincere desire to  prepare for the examination,  it was not\\nas easy as it seemed. Hottabych was  in the way. Volka had never mustered up\\nenough  courage to tell  the old man of the true consequences  of  his fatal\\nprompting. That is why he could  never  tell him  he needed time to  study,\\nsince he  feared that Hottabych might  decide to  punish  his teachers,  and\\nVarvara Stepanovna in particular, for having failed him. Hottabych made himself particularly troublesome the day of the  unusual\\nfootball match between the Shaiba and Zubilo teams. Feeling terribly  contrite for all the  anguish he had caused Volka  at\\nthe stadium, Hottabych fairly shadowed him; he tried to regain his favour by\\nscattering  compliments  and proposing the most  tempting adventures. It was\\nnot until eleven o\\'clock at night that Volka had a chance to get down to his\\nstudies. \"With  your  permission,  0  Volka,  I shall  go  to sleep,  for I feel\\nsomewhat drowsy,\" Hottabych finally said, as he yawned and crawled under the\\nbed. \"Good night, Hottabych! Sweet dreams!\" Volka answered, settling back in\\nhis chair  and gazing at his bed longingly.'),\n",

This is what  the author has to  say of  him:\" In one of Scheherezade\\'s\\ntales I red of the Fisherman who  found a copper vessel in his  net. In  the\\nvessel was a mighty Genie - a magician who had been imprisoned in the bottle\\nfor nearly two thousand years. The Genie had sworn to make the one who freed\\nhim rich, powerful and happy.\\n     \" But what if such a Genie suddenly came to life in the Soviet  Union,\\nin  Moscow? I tried to imagine  what would have  happened if a very ordinary\\nRussian boy had freed him from the vessel. \"And  imagine,  I  suddenly  discovered that  a  schoolboy  named Volka\\nKostylkov, the very same Volka who used to live on  Three Ponds Street,  you\\nknow,  the best  diver  at summer camp last year....  On second  thought,  I\\nbelieve we had better begin from the beginning....\"\\n\\nA MOST UNUSUAL MORNING\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     At 7:32 a.m. a merry sun-spot slipped through a hole in the curtain and\\nsettled on the nose of Volka Kostylkov, a 6th-grade pupil. Volka sneezed and\\nwoke up. Just then, he heard his mother say in the next room:\\n     \"Don\\'t rush, Alyosha. Let the child sleep a bit  longer, he has an exam\\ntoday.\" Volka winced. When, oh when, would his mother stop calling him a child? \"Nonsense!\" he  could  hear  his  father  answer. \"The  boy\\'s  nearly\\nthirteen. He might as well get up and help us pack. Before you know it, this\\nchild of yours will be using a razor.\" How could he have forgotten about the packing! Volka threw off  the blankets and  dressed hurriedly. How could he ever\\nhave forgotten such a day! This  was  the  day the  Kostylkov family  was moving  to  a  different\\napartment in  a new  six-storey house. Most of  their  belongings had  been\\npacked the night  before. Mother and  Grandma  had  packed the dishes  in  a\\nlittle  tin tub  that once,  very  long ago, they  had bathed Volka  in. His\\nfather had rolled up his sleeves and,  with a mouthful of nails, just like a\\nshoemaker, had spent the evening hammering down the lids on crates of books. Then they had  all argued as to the best  place to put the things so as\\nto have  them handy when the truck  arrived  in the morning. Then  they  had\\ntheir tea on an uncovered table-as on a march. Then they decided their heads\\nwould be clearer after a good night\\'s sleep and they all went to bed. In  a  word,  there  was  just  no explaining how  he  could have  ever\\nforgotten that this was the morning they, were moving to a new apartment. The  movers barged in before  breakfast was quite over. The first thing\\nthey did was to open wide both  halves  of the  door and ask in loud voices,\\n\"Well, can we begin?\"'),\n",

       "   'The  cat, named \"Homych\" in  honour  of the\\npopular football goalie, was standing on the stairs with his back arched and\\nhissing at nothing at all. Goga\\'s first thought was that the cat had gone  mad. He reflected again\\nand was nearly certain that  mad cats  kept their tails between  their legs,\\nwhile Homych\\'s tail was sticking up straight, and in all  other respects the\\nanimal looked quite healthy. Goga kicked it-just  in case. Homych\\'s yowl of pain,  surprise and hurt\\ncould be heard on the tenth floor. He jumped so high and gracefully that his\\nfamous namesake could have been proud of such a leap. Then something completely unexpected happened. A  good half  yard from the wall, Homych yowled again and flew  back in\\nthe  opposite direction,  straight at Goga,  just as though the  unfortunate\\nanimal had  hit an invisible  but very hard rubber wall. At the same  time a\\ngasp could  be heard nearby, as  if someone had trodden very hard on another\\nperson\\'s foot. Courage had never been one of Goga\\'s outstanding virtues, but\\nnow he nearly died of fright. \"Oh-h-h!\" he moaned  softly, feeling  all  numb. Finally,  tearing his\\nleaden feet from the stairs, he made a dash for his flat. When the  apartment  door  banged  shut behind  him,  Hottabych  became\\nvisible. He  was writhing  with pain and examining  his left  leg, which had\\nbeen severely scratched by the cat\\'s claws. \"Oh, cursed youth!\" Hottabych groaned,  after  first making sure he was\\nalone on the stairs. \"Oh, dog among boys!\" He fell silent  and listened. Coming slowly up the stairs, lost  in the\\nmost grievous thoughts, was his young saviour, Volka Kostylkov. The sly old  man did  not  want the boy  to  see him and  so  dissolved\\nquickly in the air. A CHAPTER WHICH IS A CONTINUATION OF THE PREVIOUS ONE\\n\\n\\n     No  matter how tempting  it  is  to  present Volka Kostylkov as  a  boy\\nwithout faults, the well-known truthfulness of the author of this tale won\\'t\\npermit him  to do  so. And if envy is to be justly considered a fault, then,\\nto our great sorrow, we must  admit  that  at times  Volka experienced  this\\nfeeling keenly. During the last few days he had been very envious  of  Goga. Long before their exams had begun, Goga boasted that his mother had promised\\nhim an Alsatian puppy as soon as he was promoted to the 7th grade. \"Sure,  you just wait!\" Volka had sniffed  at the time, feeling that he\\nwas turning cold from envy. In  his heart of hearts, he had to  admit  that Pill\\'s  words certainly\\nresembled the  truth. The  whole class knew that Goga\\'s mother never skimped\\non  anything  for  her  little  darling. She\\'d   refuse  herself  the  bare\\nnecessities of life, but  she\\'d get Goga a present that would leave them all\\nspeechless. \"She\\'ll  certainly get me a  puppy,\"  Goga persisted. \"If you  want to\\nknow, my mother never refuses me anything. If she promised, it means she\\'ll\\nbuy me one. If the worst comes to  the worst, she\\'ll borrow  some money  and\\nbuy it. You don\\'t know how highly they think of her at the factory!\" That  was true.'),\n",

Then, as if\\nhaving gathered its. strength, the rain would again pour down in torrents. Towards  morning,  when the  sky  was nearly clear  of clouds,  someone\\ntapped Volka lightly on the shoulder. He was sound asleep and did not waken.

She had not had the\\ntime to, and later on she never got  him one, for after the fantastic events\\nof  that  terrible evening, both  Goga and his  mother lost all  interest in\\nMan\\'s oldest and truest friend.

If you\\nwant to  know, not so much  as  a dog\\'s paw entered  their  house after that\\nevening. Truly, Volka had  no reason to be envious of Goga. There was nothing to\\nbe envious of: it was Goga who had barked! It all began while he was washing\\nup for supper. He was  very anxious to tell his mother a long and elaborate\\nstory  about  how his classmate and  neighbour, Volka Kostylkov,  had made a\\nfool  of himself at the examination  that morning. And it was then that  he\\nstarted  barking. Goga  didn\\'t  bark  all  the  time-some  words  were real\\nwords-but instead of very many other ones, he was surprised and horrified to\\nhear a genuine dog\\'s bark issue from his mouth. He wanted to say that Volka suddenly began to talk such nonsense at the\\nexam and that Varvara Stepanovna je-ee-st crashed her fist down on the table\\nand je-ee-st  screamed,  \"What nonsense you\\'re babbling, you fool! Why, you\\nhooligan, I\\'ll leave you back another term for this!\" But this is what Goga said instead:\\n     \"And  suddenly  Volka  je-ee-st  began  to bow-wow-wow ...  and Varvara\\nStepanovna je-ee-st crashed her bow-wow-wow!\" Goga was struck dumb with surprise. He was silent for a moment, then he\\ntook a deep breath and tried  to repeat  the sentence. But instead of saying\\nthe rude  words,  this little  liar and  tattle-tale  wanted  to  ascribe to\\nVarvara Stepanovna, he began to bark again. \"Oh, Mummie!\" he wailed. \"Mummie dear!\" \"What\\'s the matter with you, darling?\" his mother asked anxiously. \"You\\nlook terrible!\" \"I wanted to say that bow-wow-wow.... Oh, Mummie, what\\'s the matter?\" Goga had really turned blue from fright. \"Stop barking, dearest! Please stop, my darling, my sweet!\" \"I\\'m not doing it on purpose,\" Goga whined. \"I only wanted to say....\"\\n     And once again, instead of human speech, all he could do was to produce\\nan irritable bark. \"Darling!

Hurray!\" \"Exactly what happened at  the  exam?\" the old  doctor  asked,  as  if\\ncasually. \"Why, nothing special. Can\\'t a boy suddenly  become ill from overwork?\" Goga went on in a much more confident tone. \"I guess  I\\'ll be going along,\"  Alexander Alexeyevich said. \"I have to\\nvisit  a  good  dozen real patients. I  take it  you understood  everything,\\nGoga?\" \"Yes! Oh, yes! Upon my word of honour! Thank you!\" \"Well, then, keep it up! Good-bye, everyone.\" \"Where\\'d you disappear to?\" Volka  shouted  at  the old Genie  several\\nseconds later, as Hottabych crawled  back  to his place under his bed with a\\nvery thoughtful expression-on his face. \"Listen,  0  Volka,\"  the  old man  said with  great solemnity. I just\\nwitnessed a  most unusual  scene: a spell  cast by a  Genie  was broken by a\\nhuman being! True, this was a very wise and very just human being. He was so\\njust  that I didn\\'t even think  of  punishing him for not  believing  in  my\\nexistence. Where are you going? \"I have to visit Goga. I should really be ashamed of myself.\" \"Yes, do go and visit your classmate. Though he is no longer ill.\"\\n     \"Not ill at all? Did he get well so quickly?\" \"That depends entirely on him,\" Hottabych said. And  pocketing his own\\npride, he told Volka about the only known case of curing a boy who barked. HOTTABYCH AND MR.

This is not dug from\\nthe ground as  in other countries, but  is  produced, day  and  night,  by a\\ntireless species of gold-bearing ants,  which  are nearly the size of a dog.

From the north and west,  India\\nborders on a country of bald people. The men and women and even the children\\nare  all bald in this country. And these strange people live on raw fish and\\npine cones. Still closer  to them  is a  country where you  can neither  see\\nanything nor pass, as it  is filled  to the top with feathers. The earth and\\nthe air  are filled with  feathers, and that is why you can\\'t  see  anything\\nthere.\" \"Wait a  minute,  Kostylkov,\" the geography teacher said with  a smile. \"No one has asked you to tell us of the ancients\\' views on Asia\\'s geography.

The corridors\\nwere quiet and empty, a true and sad sign that the examination had begun and\\nthat he was late. \"And where are you going?\" the doorman  asked  Hottabych good-naturedly\\nas he was about to follow his young friend in. \"He\\'s come to see the principal,\" Volka shouted from the  top  \\'of  the\\nstairs. \"You won\\'t be able  to see him  now. He\\'s at an examination.

Powerful\\ndiesel engines hummed  far  below,  in the depths  of  the  ship. The  water\\nwhispered  dreamily as  it lapped against the steep  sides, and high  above,\\nover the spar deck, the ship\\'s wireless piped anxiously. \"You  know, it\\'s  really a shame that the large sailing ships  of yore,\\nthose white-winged beauties, are a thing of the  past. How happy I  would be\\nto  find myself on a real frigate...  .

If I could only see a real sailing ship! I mean a\\nreal  genuine one! Nowadays even a bark has to have a motor,  you know, even\\nthough-mark my words-it\\'s considered a sailboat!\" \"A motor-sailboat,\" a  man wearing  the uniform  of the Merchant Marine\\nadded. They fell silent. All except the sailor went over to the left side to\\nwatch a school of  tireless dolphins splash  and cavort  in the warm noonday\\nsea. Dolphins were nothing new to  the sailor. He stretched out  in a  deck\\nchair and picked up a  magazine lazily. Soon  the  sun  made him drowsy. He\\nclosed the magazine and fanned himself with it. Then something attracted his  attention. He  stopped  fanning himself,\\njumped to  his feet  and  rushed  to  the railing. Far off,  near  the very\\nhorizon, he saw a beautiful but terribly old-fashioned sailing ship skimming\\nover the waves. It seemed like something from a fairy tale. \"Everybody! Everybody  hurry  over  here!\" he  shouted. \"Look at that\\nsailing ship! Isn\\'t it ancient! Oh, and something\\'s wrong with its mainmast! It doesn\\'t have a mainmast! Why,  it just isn\\'t there! My  goodness! Just\\nlook! The sails are all billowed  out the wrong way! According to every law\\nof nature,  the  foremast should  have been blown  overboard long  ago! It\\'s\\nreally a miracle!\" However, by the time the other passengers heeded his words and returned\\nto the starboard side, the unknown vessel had disappeared from sight.

There,  on  his desk, was  the\\nstrangest letter the Central Excursion Bureau had ever received-or, for that\\nmatter, the strangest  letter ever received by any Soviet  office.

Now  he  looked at himself  in  the mirror with true  satisfaction. He\\nstroked his recovered beard and  twisted the ends of his moustache jauntily. Then he passed his hand over his hair, smoothed his eyebrows and sighed with\\nrelief. \"Excellent ! Now both our faces are back to normal again.\" As  concerns Stepan Stepanych Pivoraki, who will  never again appear on\\nthe pages of our extremely truthful story, it is a known fact that he became\\na changed man after the events described above. Why, it seems only yesterday\\nthat his friends,  who suffered so  acutely  from his  talkativeness,  named\\nevery chatter-box \"Pivoraki.\" However, he has now become so sparing with his\\nwords, weighing each one carefully beforehand,  that it is a  joy to talk to\\nhim and listen to him speak at meetings. Just think what an effect this incident had on him! AN INTERVIEW WITH A DIVER\\n\\n\\n     Zhenya Bogorad\\'s parents were up all night. They  telephoned  all their\\nfriends and, taking a cab, made the  rounds of every militia station in  the\\ncity, and of every  hospital. They even  stopped off at the  criminal court,\\nbut all to no avail. Zhenya had disappeared without a trace. The following morning  the  principal of the school  called in Zhenya\\'s\\nclassmates, including Volka, and questioned each one. Volka  told the principal  about meeting Zhenya at the movies the night\\nbefore, though he quite naturally said  nothing about his beard. The boy who\\nsat next to  Zhenya in class recalled that he had seen him on Pushkin Street\\nclose to six o\\'clock the previous  evening, that he was in high  spirits and\\nwas rushing to the movies. Other children said the same, but this was of no\\nhelp. Suddenly, one boy remembered Zhenya said he wanted to go swimming too. In half an hour\\'s time  every volunteer  life  guard in  the  city  was\\nsearching for Zhenya Bogorad\\'s  body. The river  was dragged within the city\\nlimits, but yielded  nothing. Divers traversed  the entire river-bed, paying\\nspecial attention to holes and depressions, but they, too, found nothing. The fiery blaze  of sunset was slowly sinking beyond the river, a faint\\nbreeze carried the low sounds of a siren from the recreation park,  a signal\\nthat the second act of the evening\\'s play at the summer theatre was about to\\nbegin, but the dark  silhouettes of the river  boats  could still be seen on\\nthe water. The search was still on. This  cool, quiet  evening  Volka  was  too  restless to  sit at  home. Terrifying thoughts of  Zhenya\\'s fate gave  him  no peace. He  decided to go\\nback  to school, perhaps there  was some news there.'),\n",

All at\\nonce, he stopped singing, crouched, and yanked several hairs from his beard. Volka guessed what he was doing by the slight crystal tinkling. In a word, if you ever  forget something very  important and just can\\'t\\nrecall it, there\\'s no better remedy than to fall off a magic carpet, if even\\nfor  a second. Such  a fall really clears one\\'s memory. At least it  helped\\nHottabych recall how to break spells he himself had cast. Now there was no need to continue the difficult and dangerous flight to\\nrescue the unfortunate Zhenya  Bogorad  from  slavery. Indeed, the sound of\\ncrystal tinkling was still in  the air when Zhenya fell out of  the darkness\\nand onto the magic carpet, clutching a twenty-pound bunch of bananas. \"Zhenya!\" Volka shouted happily. The  magic  carpet  could not withstand the  extra weight  and  plunged\\ndownward with a whistling sound. Suddenly, it became damp  and chilly. The\\nstars shining overhead disappeared. They had entered a cloud bank. \"Hottabych!\" Volka shouted. \"We have to get out  of here, up over  the\\nclouds!\" But Hottabych did  not answer. Through the  heavy fog they could barely\\nmake out the  shrivelled figure  with his collar turned up. The old man was\\nhurriedly yanking one  hair after another  from his beard. There was a sound\\nlike plink,  like  a  tightly stretched  string  on  a home-made  children\\'s\\nbalalaika. With a  moan of despair, Hottabych would throw out the  hair  and\\nyank out another. Once again  they\\'d hear  the plink, once again the moan of\\ndespair, and the despondent mumbling of the old Genie. \"Hey, Volka,\" Zhenya said, \"What\\'s this we\\'re flying  on? It looks like\\na magic carpet.\" \"That\\'s exactly what it is. Hottabych, what\\'s taking you so long?\" \"There\\'s no such thing as a magic carpet,\" Zhenya said. \"Help!\" The carpet had dipped sharply. Volka had no time to argue with Zhenya. \"Hottabych, what\\'s the matter?\" he said, tugging at the old man\\'s damp\\ncoat sleeve. \"0  woe is  me!\" came the  hollow, sobbing  voice of a faintly  visible\\nHottabych through  the whistling of the falling carpet. \"0 woe is all of us! I\\'m soaked from head to toe!\" \"We\\'re all drenched!\" Volka shouted back angrily. \"What selfishness!\" \"My beard! Alas, my beard is wet!\" \"Ha, what a thing to worry about!\" Zhenya smirked. \"My beard  is  wet!\" Hottabych  repeated  in terrible  grief. \"I\\'m  as\\nhelpless  as a babe. You need dry hair for  magic,  the very  driest kind of\\nhair!\" \"We\\'ll  go  smack  against the ground!\" Volka said in a  wooden voice. \"There\\'ll just be a little wet spot left from all of us.\" \"Wait! Wait  a  minute!\" Zhenya panted. \"The main thing is not to  get\\npanicky! What do people in balloons do in such a case? In  such a case, people flying  in balloons throw  their  extra ballast\\noverboard.

It was the ring with the inscription: \"Wear\\nit, Katya, and remember me,\" which Mr. Moneybags must have lost as he rolled\\naway.

EXTRA TICKETS\\n\\n\\n     On a bright and sunny summer day our friends set out  to see a football\\ngame. During the soccer season  the entire  population  of Moscow is divided\\ninto two alien  camps. In the one are the football  fans; in the other  are\\nthose queer people who are entirely indifferent to this fascinating sport. Long before the beginning of the game, these  first stream  towards the\\nhigh entrance gates of the Central Stadium from all parts of the city. They  look upon those who are heading in  the opposite direction with a\\nfeeling of superiority. In  turn,  these  other  Muscovites shrug in  amazement when  they  see\\nhundreds of crowded buses  and trolley-buses and thousands  of cars crawling\\nthrough the turbulent sea of pedestrian fans. But  the  army  of  fans  which  appears  so unified  to an onlooker is\\nactually torn into two camps. This is unnoticeable while the fans are making\\ntheir way to the stadium. However, as they approach the gates, this division\\nappears  in  all its ugliness. It suddenly becomes  evident that some people\\nhave tickets,  while others do  not. The possessors  of tickets pass through\\nthe gates  confidently; the others dart back and forth excitedly, rushing at\\nnew arrivals with the same plaintive plea: \"D\\'you  have an extra ticket?\" or\\n\"You don\\'t have an extra ticket, do you?\" As a rule, there are so few extra tickets and so many people in need of\\nthem, that if  not for Hottabych, Volka and Zhenya would have certainly been\\nleft outside the gates. \"With the greatest of pleasure,\" Hottabych murmured in reply to Volka\\'s\\nrequest. \"You\\'ll have as many as you need in a minute.\" No sooner were  these words  out of  his  mouth, than the boy  saw  him\\nholding  a whole  sheaf  of blue, green  and yellow  tickets. \"Will  this be\\nenough, 0  wonderful Volka?

THE UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER\\n\\n\\n     If  you  recall,  dear  readers,  it  was  a  hot  July noon  when  the\\nice-breaker \"Ladoga\" sailed from  the Red  Pier in  the port of  Arkhangelsk\\nwith a large group of excursionists on board. Our three  friends, Hottabych,\\nVolka  and Zhenya, were among the passengers. Hottabych was sitting on deck,\\nconversing  solemnly  with  a  middle-aged  fitter  from  Sverdlovsk on  the\\nadvantages of cloth shoes  as compared to leather  ones,  pointing  out  the\\ncomfort people suffering from old corns found in cloth shoes. Volka and Zhenya were leaning on the railing of the top deck. They were\\nas happy as only boys can be who are aboard a real ice-breaker for the first\\ntime in their lives, and, to top it all, are sailing away for a whole month,\\nnot to just any old place, but to the Arctic. After  exchanging  opinions  on   boats,  diesel  ships,  ice-breakers,\\ntug-boats, schooners,  trawlers, cutters, and other types of craft  skimming\\nover the surface of the Northern  Dvina,  the boys fell silent, enchanted by\\nthe beauty of the great river. \"Isn\\'t that something!\" Volka said  in a voice that seemed to imply  he\\nwas responsible for all this beauty. \"Uh-huh.\" \"Nobody\\'d believe it if you told them.\" \"Uh-huh!\" \"I\\'m really glad that we. ..\" Volka began after a long pause and looked\\naround cautiously to see if Hottabych was anywhere  nearby. Just in case, he\\ncontinued in a whisper, \"... that we\\'ve taken the old  man away from Varvara\\nStepanovna for at least a month.\" \"Sure,\" Zhenya agreed. \"There\\'s  the  Mate  in  charge  of the  passengers,\" Volka  whispered,\\nnodding towards a young sailor with a freckled face. They looked with awe at the man who carried his high and romantic title\\nso nonchalantly. His glance  slid over the  young passengers unseeingly and\\ncame to rest on a sailor who was leaning on the railing nearby. \"What\\'s the matter, are you feeling homesick?\" \"Well,  here  we  are,  off  again  for  a whole month  to  the  end of\\nnowheres.\" The boys were amazed to discover that someone might  not  want to go to\\nthe Arctic! What a strange fellow! \"A real sailor is a  guest on  shore and at home at sea!\" the Passenger\\nMate said weightily. \"Did you ever hear that saying?\" \"Well, I can\\'t say I\\'m a real sailor, since I\\'m only a waiter.\" \"Then get one dinner in the  galley and take it  to Cabin 14, to a lady\\nnamed Koltsova.\" \"That\\'s  the same last name as Varvara  Stepanovna has,\" Volka remarked\\nto Zhenya. \"Uh-huh.\" \"She\\'s  a middle-aged lady and  she caught cold on the  way here,\"  the\\nMate  explained. \"It\\'s nothing  very serious,\" he said,  as  if to  calm the\\nwaiter, though the latter did not appear  in  any  way alarmed at the lady\\'s\\nstate  of health.'),\n",

They could do it  in peace since Hottabych, who was usually in a rush to get\\nback, was staying behind to play chess with the captain. \"Volka,\" Zhenya said  mysteriously when they dragged their feet  aboard\\nthe \"Ladoga\" three hours  later. \"Come on down to  the cabin! I want to show\\nyou something. Here, look at this,\" he continued,  after shutting  the door\\ntightly. He pulled a longish object from under  his coat. \"What d\\'you think\\nit is? I found it on the opposite side of the island. Right near the water.\" Zhenya was holding a small copper vessel the size of a decanter. It was\\nall green from age and brine. \"We should give it  to the captain right away,\" Volka  said  excitedly. \"Some expedition probably put  a letter inside and threw it  into the water,\\nhoping someone would come to the rescue.\" \"That\\'s what I thought at first, too, but then I decided  nothing would\\nhappen if we opened it first to have a look  inside. It\\'s interesting, isn\\'t\\nit?\" \"It sure is.\" Zhenya turned pale from excitement. He quickly knocked off the tar-like\\nsubstance that  covered the mouth of  the  bottle. Under it was a heavy lead\\ncap covered with a seal. Zhenya had great difficulty prying it loose. \"And now we\\'ll see what\\'s inside,\" he said, turning it upside-down over\\nhis berth. Before he had  time to finish the sentence, clouds of black smoke began\\npouring from the bottle, filling the entire cabin. It became dark and choky. Presently, the  thick vapour condensed and became an unsightly  old man with\\nan angry face and a pair of eyes that burnt like coals. He fell to his knees\\nand knocked his forehead on the floor so hard that the things hanging on the\\ncabin wall swayed as if the ship was rolling. \"0 Prophet of Allah, do not kill me!\" he shouted. \"I\\'d  like  to  ask  you something,\"  a  frightened  but curious  Volka\\ninterrupted  his wailing. \"If  I\\'m not  mistaken,  you mean the  former King\\nSolomon, don\\'t you?\" \"Yes, 0 miserable youth!

Varvara\\nStepanovna sends  you her regards,\"  his  father  said  to his  mother. \"She\\nwanted to know how Volka is. She said not to worry,  because they think very\\nhighly of him, and she suggests he have a good rest.\" Volka strained  his  ears  listening  to what  his parents were talking\\nabout, but unable to make anything  out, he  fell asleep. This time he slept\\nno longer than fifteen minutes. The telephone rang again. \"Yes,  speaking,\" he  heard  his father\\'s muffled voice. \"Yes....  Good\\nevening.... What?... No, he\\'s  not here.... Yes,  he\\'s at home.... Certainly\\nhe\\'s at home.... That\\'s quite all right.... Good-bye.\" \"Who was it?\" Volka\\'s  mother called from  the kitchen. \"It was Zhenya\\nBogorad\\'s father. He sounded  very worried. Zhenya\\'s not home yet. He wanted\\nto know whether he was here and if Volka was at home.\" \"In my time,\" Grandma said, \"only hussars came home this late, but when\\na child....\"\\n     Half  an hour later  the  ringing of the  telephone interrupted Volka\\'s\\nsleep for the third time that troubled night. It was Zhenya\\'s mother. He had\\nstill not returned. She wanted them to ask Volka if he knew where he was. \"Volka!\" his father called, opening the door. \"Zhenya\\'s mother wants to\\nknow where you saw him  last.\" \"At the  movies this evening.\" \"And after the\\nmovie?\" \"I  didn\\'t  see him after that.\" \"Did he  say  where  he  was going\\nafterwards?\" \"No.\" For a long, long time  after that,  Volka  waited for the grown-ups  to\\nstop talking about Zhenya\\'s disappearance (he himself was not the least  bit\\nworried, since he was sure Zhenya had gone to  the  circus in the recreation\\npark to celebrate), but he fell asleep again before they did. This time till\\nmorning. Soon there was a soft splash in the corner. Then the patter of wet bare\\nfeet could be  heard. Footprints appeared and quickly  dried on the  floor. Someone invisible was silently pacing  the room, humming a plaintive Eastern\\nmelody. The  footprints  headed towards  the  table  where  an  alarm clock was\\nticking away. There was the sound of lips smacking together  with pleasure. Then the alarm clock floated into the air, and for a while it hung suspended\\nbetween the ceiling and  the floor. Then  it  returned to the table and the\\nfootprints headed towards the aquarium. Once again there was  a splash. Then\\nall was quiet. Late that night it began to rain. The raindrops pattered on the window,\\nthey rustled  the  leaves of the trees  and gurgled in  the drain-pipes.'),\n",

This\\none\\'s  made of iron. Oh well, no  matter.... Where\\'s the  seal? Aha, here it\\nis!\" Volka said, inspecting the vessel carefully from all sides. Suddenly he turned pale and shouted:\\n     \"Quick, lie down! Zhenya, lie down! Hottabych, throw it right back into\\nthe water and lie down!\" \"You\\'re mad!\" Hottabych said indignantly. \"I\\'ve dreamed  of our meeting\\nfor so many years, and now, after finding him, you want me to throw him back\\nto the waves.\" \"Throw it  as far out  as you  can!

Do you hear?!\" Shrugging in dismay, Hottabych raised the heavy object, heaved  it  and\\ntossed it at least 200 yards from the shore. Before he  had  a chance to turn for an  explanation towards Volka, who\\nwas  standing  beside him, there  was a terrible  explosion at  the spot the\\nvessel hit the  water. A huge pillar of water rose over the calm surface  of\\nthe lagoon and fell apart with a loud crash. Thousands of stunned and killed\\nfish floated bellies up on the waves. People were already running towards them, attracted by the sound of the\\nexplosion. \"Let\\'s run!\" Volka commanded. They hurried to the highway and headed towards the city. A grieved Hottabych lagged behind and kept turning round constantly. He\\nwas still not convinced that he had done right by obeying Volka. \"What  did  you see on the thing?\" Zhenya  asked when  he had caught up\\nwith Volka, who was way ahead of him and Hottabych.\\n     \" \\'Made in USA,\\' that\\'s what!\" \"So it was a bomb.\" \"No, it  was a  mine. There\\'s  a big difference! It  was an underwater\\nmine.\" Hottabych sighed sadly. When Hottabych  saw that Omar was  not to be found in the Mediterranean\\nSea, he suggested that they set out to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. The\\nsuggestion in itself was extremely tempting.

However, she immediately did a long, graceful loop in the air and  landed on\\nthe stage in front of the screen. \"What were  you screeching about?

The  great Jirjis, son  of Rejmus, grandson of the Aunt of\\nIkrash, was heading straight for us, spitting fire and death!\" \"What Jirjis? Which aunt? It was just an ordinary locomotive!\" \"Has my young master decided to teach his old Genie Hassan Abdurrakhman\\nibn Hottab what a Shaitan is?\" Hottabych asked acidly. Volka realized that it would take much more than  five minutes and much\\nmore than an hour to tell him what a movie and a locomotive were. After Hottabych recovered his  breath, he asked mildly, \"What would you\\ndesire now, 0 treasured apple of my eye?\" \"As if you didn\\'t know. I want to get rid of my beard!\" \"Alas,\" the old man sighed, \"I am as yet helpless  to fulfil your wish. But perhaps you\\'d like something else instead?

Ten minutes later a tired barber stuck his\\nhead into the waiting room and shouted:\\n     \"Next!\" Then, from a corner  near  the coat-rack, rose  a  boy whose  face  was\\nwrapped in an expensive silk scarf. He  hurriedly sat  down in the barber\\'s\\nchair. \"You  want  a  hair-cut?\" the  barber  asked. \"No,  a shave!\" the boy\\nanswered  in a hollow voice and removed the scarf  that had  covered most of\\nhis face.

It was  after seven, but it  was still\\nlight outdoors and  very hot. \"Is there any place in your blessed city where\\nthey sell sherbets or cold drinks like sherbet and where we could quench our\\nthirst?\" Hottabych asked. \"Why, that\\'s an idea! A glass of cold lemonade would really be grand.\" Entering the first  juice and mineral water shop they saw,  they took a\\ntable. \"We\\'d like two bottles of  lemonade, please,\" Volka said.

But his young\\nsaviour was  so  upset by  the  terrible  news  that  he  really didn\\'t  pay\\nattention to having been called dope for nothing. \"That\\'s horrible!\" Volka  cried,  holding  his head. \"Hottabych,  d\\'you\\nrealize what you\\'ve done?\" \"Hassan Abdurrakhman ibn Hottab always realizes what he does!\" \"Like hell you  do! For no reason  at  all, you\\'re  ready  to turn good\\npeople into sparrows  or  sell  them  into slavery. Bring Zhenya back  here\\nimmediately!\" \"No!\" Hottabych shook his head. \"Don\\'t demand the impossible of me!\" \"But  do you  find it possible to sell people into slavery? Golly,  you\\ncan\\'t even imagine what I\\'ll do if you don\\'t bring Zhenya right back!\" To  tell the  truth, Volka himself  had no  idea what he could do -s to\\nsave  Zhenya from  the clutches  of unknown slave dealers, but he would have\\nthought of something. He would have written to some  ministry or  other. But\\nwhich ministry? And what was he to say? By now  the readers of this  book know Volka  well enough to agree that\\nhe\\'s  no  cry-baby. But  this  was  too  much,  even  for  Volka. Yes,  our\\ncourageous, fearless Volka sat  down on the edge of the first bench  he came\\nupon and broke into tears of helpless rage. The old man asked anxiously:\\n     \"What is the meaning of  this crying that has overcome  you? Answer me,\\nand do not tear my heart apart, 0 my young saviour.\" But Volka, regarding the old man with hate-filled eyes;\\n     pushed him away as he leaned over him with concern. Hottabych  looked  at  Volka  closely,   sucked  his  lips   and   said\\nthoughtfully:\\n     \"I\\'m really amazed. No  matter what I do, it just doesn\\'t seem to make\\nyou happy. Though I\\'m  trying  my best to please you, all my efforts  are in\\nvain. The most powerful potentates of the  East and  West would often appeal\\nto my magic powers, and  there was not  a  single one among them who was not\\ngrateful  to me later and did not glorify my name in words and thoughts. And\\nlook at me now! I\\'m  trying to understand what\\'s  wrong, but I cannot. Is it\\nsenility? Ah, I\\'m getting old!\" \"Oh no, no, Hottabych, you  still look very young,\" Volka  said through\\nhis tears. And true enough, the old man was well preserved for being close on four\\nthousand years of age. No one would have ever given him more than seventy or\\nseventy-five. Any of our readers would have looked much older at his age. \"You flatter me,\" Hottabych smiled and  added: \"No, it is not within my\\npowers to return your friend Zhenya immediately.\" Volka\\'s face turned ashen from grief.'),\n",

And only Volka,  who knew  Hottabych so  well, noticed that a secret thought\\nwas  constantly gnawing at the old Genie. Hottabych often sighed, he stroked\\nhis  beard thoughtfully, and  large tears would  ever so often roll from his\\nfrank, friendly eyes. Volka  would  pretend not to notice and did not bother the old man with\\ntactless questions. He  was convinced that in the end Hottabych would be the\\nfirst to speak. That is exactly what happened. \"Grief  and  sadness rent  my old  heart, 0  noble  saviour of Genies,\"\\nHottabych said softly one day when a magnificent sunset coloured the evening\\nwaters  of the  Moskva River  a delicate  pink. \"Thoughts of my  poor  lost\\nbrother and of his terrible and hapless fate do not  leave me for  a moment. The more I think of him, the more I feel I should set out to search  for him\\nas soon  as possible. What do  you think of this,  0 wise Volka ibn Alyosha? And  if  you regard this  decision kindly, would  you  not make me happy  by\\nsharing the joys and sorrows of this journey with me?\" \"Where do you want to start looking for your brother?\" Volka asked in a\\nbusiness-like way, since he was  no longer surprised at  the most unexpected\\nsuggestions Hottabych might have. \"If  you  remember, 0 Volka,  at  the very dawn of  our extremely happy\\nacquaintance, I told you that Sulayman\\'s  Genies threw  him into one of  the\\nSouthern Seas, sealed in a copper vessel. There, along the shores of the hot\\ncountries, is where one must naturally look for Omar Asaf.\" The possibility of setting out on a journey to the Southern Seas really\\nappealed to Volka. \"All right. I\\'ll come  along with you. Wherever you go,  I go. It would\\nbe nice if.. .\" Volka fumbled. But a cheerful Hottabych continued: \".. .if we could take our wonderful\\nfriend  Zhenya ibn  Kolya  along. Have I understood you correctly, 0 my kind\\nVolka ibn Alyosha?\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"There could not have been a  shadow of doubt,\"  Hottabych said. It was\\ndecided  then  and there  that  the expedition setting  out  to  search  for\\nHottabych\\'s unfortunate brother would leave no later than in two days\\' time. However, if the  time of departure caused ho discord, it quite suddenly\\nbecame apparent that there  were  serious  differences on  the question of a\\nmeans of transportation. \"Let\\'s  go by magic  carpet,\" Hottabych suggested. \"There\\'s enough room\\nfor all of us.\" \"Oh no,\" Volka objected strongly. \"No more magic carpets for me. Thanks\\na lot! Our  last trip was enough for me. I don\\'t want to freeze like a dog a\\nsecond time.\" \"I\\'ll  supply you both with warm clothing, 0  blessed Volka. And if you\\nso desire, a large bonfire will constantly burn in the middle of the carpet. We can warm ourselves beside it during our flight.\" \"No, no,  no! The magic carpet is out of the  question.

He grabbed his two young friends\\nand, to the general amazement,  began juggling them as  if they were plastic\\nbilliard balls  stead of sturdy thirteen-year-old  boys. The  applause which\\nfollowed was so deafening, the whole scene might very well have taken  place\\nat a weight-lifting contest and not on board a ship in danger. \"I  take  my words back,\" the captain said  solemnly after the applause\\nhad died down. \"And now, let\\'s get to work! There\\'s time to waste!\" \"Hottabych,\" Volka said,  -taking the old man off to a side \"what\\'s the\\nuse of dragging coal from one hold to another for twelve long hours? I think\\nyou should do something to get the ship off the shoal.\" \"That\\'s not within my powers,\" the old man answered sadly \"I thought of\\nit already. Naturally, I can pull it off the rocks, but then the bottom will\\nbe all scratched and ripped, and I won\\'t  b able to fix it, because I  never\\nsaw what a ship looks like on the  bottom. Then we\\'ll certainly drown  in no\\ntime.\" \"Think again, Hottabych! Maybe you\\'ll think of some thing!\" \"I\\'ll try my best, 0  compass of my soul,\" the old man replied. After a\\nshort pause he asked, \"What if I make the rocks disappear?\" \"Oh, Hottabych! How smart you are!\" Volka said  and  began to shake his\\nhand. \"That\\'s a wonderful idea.\" \"I hear and I obey.\" The first emergency  team was down in the hold, loading  the first iron\\nbins with coal, when  the \"Ladoga\"  suddenly lurched and then began  to spin\\naround in a  whirlpool over the  spot where there had just  been a shoal. In\\nanother  minute,  the  ship would  have broken to bits, had  not Volka sense\\nenough to tell  Hottabych to  make  the  whirlpool disappear. The sea became\\ncalm; the \"Ladoga\" spun  around a while longer from  sheer force of inertia. Then it continued on its way. Once again, no one but Hottabych and Volka knew what he happened. Ahead were more exciting days, each unlike the other, as they journeyed\\nacross  little-known  seas  and channels, past bleak  islands  upon which no\\nhuman foot had ever stepped. The passengers often left the ship to go ashore\\non  deserted cliffs  and  on  islands where polar station teams greeted them\\nwith  rifle salvos. Our three friends joined the rest in climbing  glaciers,\\nwandering over the naked stones of basalt plateaux, jumping from ice-floe to\\nice-floe  over black  open  patches  of water, and  hunting polar bears. The\\nfearless Hottabych dragged one bear aboard the \"Ladoga\" by the scruff of its\\nneck. Under his  influence the  animal soon became  as tame and playful as a\\ncat, and so provided many happy hours for both  passengers and crew.

In the\\noffice  on  the  first  floor  the principal  and  Varvara  Stepanovna  were\\ndiscussing school problems, and on the third floor the loud, cheerful voices\\nof  the painters and plasterers echoed through the  halls. It was summer and\\nthe school was being renovated. \"Well,  my dear  Varvara Stepanovna, what shall  I say?\" the  principal\\nsaid  with a smile. \"One can only envy such a vacation. How long will you be\\ngone?\" \"I believe for a month or so.\" Volka was  glad to hear that Varvara Stepanovna  would not be in danger\\nof encountering Hottabych for at least a  month.

Have you prepared for your examination?\" \"Yes, I have.\" \"Well, then, let\\'s have a little talk.\" The little talk embraced almost the whole of sixth-grade geography. If\\nVolka had  thought of looking at the time, he would have  been  surprised to\\nnote that their little talk lasted nearly twenty minutes. But he couldn\\'t be\\nbothered  with  the  time. He  thought the  principal was  not  asking  the\\nquestions  in great enough detail. He felt he could speak  on each topic for\\nfive or ten minutes. He was experiencing the tormenting and at once pleasant\\nfeeling of a pupil who knows  his subject inside-out and is most worried  by\\nthe thought that this fact might go unnoticed by his examiners. But one look\\nat  Varvara Stepanovna convinced him that she was pleased  with his answers. Nevertheless, when  the  principal said, \"Good for you! Now  I can see  that\\nyour teacher hasn\\'t wasted her time on you,\" Volka felt a pleasant chill run\\ndown  his spine. His freckled face spread into  such  a broad smile that the\\nprincipal and Varvara Stepanovna smiled, too. \"Yes, Kostylkov has  obviously put in a lot  of studying,\"  his teacher\\nsaid. Ah, if they only  knew of the terribly difficult conditions under which\\nVolka had to prepare for his exam!

For a moment, Volka was on the point of boasting of his  own success as\\na  teacher (not everyone can proudly say he has taught  a  Genie to read and\\nwrite! ), but he checked himself in time. \"Well,  Kostylkov, congratulations on  passing to the 7th grade! Have a\\ngood rest until September. Get strong and healthy! Goodbye for now!\" \"Thank you,\" Volka replied  as discreetly as  a 7th-grade pupil should. \"Good-bye.\" When  he  arrived at  the  river bank,  Hottabych, who had made himself\\ncomfortable in  the shade of a mighty oak,  was reading the  paper aloud  to\\nZhenya. \"I passed!'),\n",

HOTTABYCH\\'S NEW YEAR VISIT\\n\\n     During the  winter vacation,  Zhenya went  to  visit his  relatives  in\\nZvenigorod.

In the first place,  this was the first\\nletter he had ever received in which he was addressed by his full name, as a\\ngrown  man. In the second place, it was the first letter Hottabych  had ever\\nwritten to his young  friend. But  of greatest interest were the contents of\\nthis most remarkable message. Following is the letter, slightly abridged:\\n     \"0 most  lovable  and precious friend, the sweet and singular adornment\\nof  all  schools  and sports fields, the fond  hope of your native  arts and\\nsciences, the joy  and pride of your parents and friends,  Zhenya ibn Kolya,\\nfrom the famous and noble family of Bogorads, may your life\\'s road be strewn\\nwith  thornless  roses  and  may  it  be  as  long  as  your  pupil,  Hassan\\nAbdurrakhman ibn Hottab, wishes it to be! \"I  hope you  remember how great  my  joy and  gratitude were when, six\\nmonths  ago, you, 0 my young friend and friend of my young saviour, released\\nmy unfortunate brother Omar Asaf ibn  Hottab, from whom I  was so grievously\\nseparated for many centuries,  from his  horrible imprisonment in the copper\\nvessel. \"But  immediately following my first  joy  of  a  long-awaited reunion,\\nthere  came a  terrible disappointment, for my brother  turned out to  be an\\nungrateful,  short-sighted, narrow-minded, grouchy and  envious  person. And\\nhe, as you  well remember, took it upon himself to fly to the Moon, in order\\nto be convinced whether its surface was truly covered with mountains, as our\\nhighly educated friend  Volka ibn Alyosha stated, basing his knowledge on  a\\nscience called Astronomy. \"Alas! It was not a selfless thirst for knowledge that guided my unwise\\nbrother, nor the  noble and  exemplary desire  to discover the World,  but a\\nvain and ignorant wish to belittle and shame a person  who had tried to hold\\nhim back from committing a fatal deed. \"He  did not even take into account  the laws of another science called\\n\\'Mechanics,\\' and thereby doomed himself to  an eternal and useless  circling\\nof the Earth, which, as I  recently discovered (who could have ever  dreamed\\nof it!) in turn revolves around the Sun! \"Three days  ago  I received a message from you,  0  Zhenya  ibn Kolya,\\nwhich  bears  the  scientific  name  of  \\'Telegram,\\'  and  in  which you  so\\ngraciously  and pleasantly  wished me a Happy New Year.

While he  was  wondering  which of the slips of  paper laid out  on the\\ntable he  should choose, old  man Hottabych slipped  through the wall in the\\ncorridor  and  disappeared  through  the  opposite  one  into  an  adjoining\\nclassroom. He had an absorbed look on his face. Volka finally took the first slip his hand touched. Tempting his fate,\\nhe turned it over  very slowly, but was pleasantly surprised to see  that he\\nwas to  speak on India. He knew quite a lot about India, since he had always\\nbeen interested in that country. \"Well, let\\'s hear what you have to say,\" the principal said. Volka  even remembered  the beginning of the chapter  on India word for\\nword as it was in his book.'),\n",

They\\nhave  been in Arabia  for not less than five minutes already. That is where\\nthey reside, that is  where they are now awaiting my orders. But please tell\\nme,  0 masts of my heart, why should we not continue our journey aboard  the\\n\\'Sweet Omar\\'?\" \"I thought we made that clear,\" Volka said. \"And anyway, a sailing ship is too slow and unreliable. We\\'re dependent\\non every little change in the weather. No, the  \\'Sweet Omar\\' is out,\" Zhenya\\nsaid. \"0  anchors of my  happiness!\" Hottabych  whined pitifully. \"I\\'ll  do\\nanything to....\"\\n     \"No,  it\\'s  out,  and  that\\'s  the  end of  it,\"  Volka interrupted and\\nshivered. It was most unpleasant  to  lie in the  water fully  dressed. \"It\\nremains to be seen what else Hottabych can suggest.\" \"I can take you under my arms and fly.\" \"No good!\" Volka said. \"Who wants to fly under somebody\\'s arms!\" \"Not somebody\\'s-mine!\" Hottabych replied in a hurt voice. \"It makes no difference.\" \"Then  I would  venture  to suggest  to your enlightened  attention the\\nmagic  carpet. It  is  an excellent  means  of transportation,  0  my choosy\\nfriends!\" \"There\\'s  nothing excellent about it. You  freeze on  it,  and it\\'s too\\nslow, and there\\'s  no comforts at all,\" Volka said thoughtfully and suddenly\\nexclaimed, \"I\\'ve got it! Upon my word of honour, I have a wonderful idea!\" At  this, he went under, as in his excitement he could think of nothing\\nbetter to do than clap  his hands. He bobbed  up again, huffing and spitting\\nwater, and  then resumed his comfortable position on his back, continuing as\\nif nothing had happened:\\n     \"We have to  modernize the magic carpet:  it should  be streamlined and\\ncold-resistant, and it should have bunks and be on pontoons.\" It  was  most difficult  to explain Volka\\'s  idea  to Hottabych. In the\\nfirst place,  the  old man  did  not know what  \"streamlined\" meant. In the\\nsecond place, he could not visualize a pair of pontoons. It would seem that \"streamlined\" was such  a  simple word, but they had\\nto explain and explain  until  they finally  hit upon the  thought of saying\\nthat a streamlined magic carpet should look like a hollowed-out cucumber. It\\nalso  took  a great deal of  explaining to  make  Hottabych  understand what\\npontoons  were  like. Finally,  a  streamlined \"VK-1\"  magic-carpet-seaplane\\nsoared into the  air and set its course at  South-South-West. In translation\\nto ordinary words, \"VK-1\" meant \"Vladimir Kostylkov. First Model.\" This magic-carpet-seaplane, resembling a huge cucumber with a tiny stem\\nin  back, had  three berths  and two windows  on each  side, cut through the\\nheavy carpeting. The flying  qualities  of  Volka\\'s plane were  immeasurably superior to\\nthose  of  an ordinary  magic  carpet. The Black  Sea,  the  Bosporus,  the\\nDardanelles,  Asia Minor  and  the sun-parched plateau of Arabia flashed  by\\nbelow. Then  they saw the  yellow sands of the Sinai Desert.'),\n",

The old man  saw Volka was upset, yet he was too tactful to\\nannoy  him with his questions. Thus, they continued on in silence, each lost\\nin his own thoughts. Soon they were walking down the wide granite embankment\\nof the Moskva River. \"What  kind of  strange-headed  people  are  standing  in  those  frail\\nvessels?\" the old man asked, pointing to the river boats. \"Those are divers,\" Volka answered sadly. \"Peace be  with you, 0 noble  diver,\" Hottabych said  grandly to one of\\nthe divers climbing out of a boat near the bank. \"What are you searching for\\non the bottom of this beautiful river?\" \"A boy drowned,\" the  diver answered  and hurried  up the steps  of the\\nfirst-aid station. \"I have no more questions, 0 highly respected diver,\" Hottabych said to\\nhis disappearing back. Then he returned to Volka, bowed low and exclaimed:\\n     \"I kiss the ground beneath your feet, 0 most noble student of Secondary\\nSchool No. 245!\" \"Huh?\" Volka started, shaken from his unhappy thoughts. \"Am I correct  in  understanding that this  diver is searching for  the\\nyouth who has the great honour of being your classmate?\" Volka nodded silently and heaved a great sigh. \"Is  he  round  of face,  sturdy of body, snub of nose  and sporting  a\\nhaircut unbecoming to a boy?\" \"Yes, that was Zhenya. He  had a haircut like a real dandy,\" Volka said\\nand sighed heavily again. \"Did we see him in the movies? Was it he who shouted something  to  you\\nand made you sad, because he\\'d tell everyone you had such a beard?\" \"Yes. How did you know what I was thinking then?\" \"Because  that\\'s  what  you mumbled  when  you  tried to  conceal  your\\nhonourable and most beautiful face from  him,\" the old man continued. \"Don\\'t\\nfear, he won\\'t tell!\" \"That\\'s not true!\" Volka said angrily. \"That doesn\\'t bother me at all.

       "   'There is  nothing more dangerous than falling asleep on a magic  carpet\\nwithout having first taken the necessary precautions. Tired from  all their experiences and lulled to sleep by  the  complete\\nquiet that  surrounded them, Hottabych and  Volka did not  notice  how  they\\ndozed off under the warm quilted robes that had appeared from nowheres. Volka had curled up cosily and  slept a dreamless sleep, but Hottabych,\\nwho  had  fallen  asleep  sitting  up uncomfortably, with his  chest pressed\\nagainst his sharp old knees, had a terrible dream. He  dreamt  that the servants  of  Sulayman, son of  David, led  by the\\nVizier Asaf ibn Barakhiya, were  once  again about to imprison him in a clay\\nvessel  and that they had stuffed him halfway in  already, but that  he  was\\nstruggling desperately, pressing  his chest against the mouth of the bottle. He  dreamt  that his  wonderful young  friend  and  saviour was about  to be\\nstuffed into another vessel and then  neither of them would ever be rescued,\\nwhile  poor  Zhenya would have to suffer the  slave\\'s  lot to the end of his\\ndays,  with  no one  to  save him. Worst of all, someone had a firm  hold on\\nHottabych\\'s arms so that he was  unable to yank a single hair from his beard\\nand therefore was  unable to use his magic powers to save himself and Volka. Realizing that  it would be too late to  do anything in a few more  moments,\\nHottabych  exerted all his energy. In  great despair  he  plunged sideways,\\nforcefully enough to fall completely out of the vessel. Before really waking\\nup, he slipped off the carpet into the cold black void below. Fortunately, his  shout  awakened Volka. The boy was just able to  grab\\nhis  left arm. Now it was Hottabych\\'s turn to fly in  tow behind the carpet. However, the tow was not very  firm: the old man was  too  heavy  for Volka. They  would  probably  have plunged downwards  from this great height to the\\nunseen  Earth below, if Hottabych had  not managed  to yank a whole batch of\\nhair from his beard with his  free hand and rattle  off  the necessary magic\\nwords. Suddenly, Volka found he could pull the old man up quite easily. Our  young  fellow\\'s  happiness  would  have  been  complete,  had  not\\nHottabych been bellowing,  \"Aha, 0 Volka! Everything\\'s in  top  shape, 0 my\\nprecious one!\" and trying to sing something and laughing with such wild glee\\nall the while  Volka was pulling him  up that he really became worried: what\\nif  the old  man had  lost his mind from fright? True, once Hottabych  found\\nhimself on the carpet, he  stopped singing. Yet, he could think  of  nothing\\nbetter to do  than begin a jig. And this in  the  middle of  the night! On a\\nshabby, threadbare old magic carpet! \"Tra-la-la, 0 Volka! Tra-la-la, 0 ibn Alyosha!\" Hottabych yelled in the\\ndarkness, raising his  long skinny  legs  high and  constantly  running  the\\ndanger of falling off the carpet again. Finally, he gave in  to Volka\\'s pleas and  stopped dancing. Instead, he\\nbegan to sing again.'),\n",

Next morning Hottabych awoke in the prime of health. \"That\\'s what  medical attention administered  in  time can  do!\" Zhenya\\nsaid  with satisfaction. Then  and there he decided to be a doctor  when  he\\ngrew up. ONE IN WHICH WE RETURN TO THE BARKING BOY\\n\\n\\n     To tell the truth, each time  Volka thought of Goga, he became terribly\\nenvious. If  he  was at home  or on  the  stairs, or  downstairs  near  the\\nentrance, it was difficult not to think of Goga:\\n     ever  so  often  a teasing,  wonderful,  marvellous  barking  could  be\\nheard-even through closed doors and closed windows. It was most strange, however, that Goga did not come  outside. No other\\nboy  in his place  could ever have  been  able to stay  away so long and not\\nboast to his friends about his real, pure-breed puppy. And Goga, especially,\\nwould have gloated to see the children so envious. There was something strange about it all. Finally, Volka could not keep\\nfrom  asking  Goga\\'s  mother  what  the  matter  was. She  became  terribly\\nembarrassed and mumbled something about  her dear  boy being sick. Then she\\nrushed off. \"Wait  a minute!\" Volka  pleaded. \"Can I ask  you something? Just  one\\nquestion?\" Goga\\'s mother stopped reluctantly. \"Can you just tell me if it\\'s an Alsatian? Is it?\" \"What Alsatian?\" the poor woman shrugged. \"The  puppy you gave  Goga. You  know, the one that\\'s barking. Is it an\\nAlsatian or a Boxer?\" \"Goodness, what nonsense!\" she sighed and disappeared quickly  into her\\napartment. As if for spite, a high-pitched angry barking issued forth. It was all very mysterious. Just then Hottabych,  who  was lying in  his usual  place under Volka\\'s\\nbed, asked casually:\\n     \"I wonder how your enemy named Pill is getting on?\" He  yearned to boast  about the  cunning spell  he  had cast on him and\\nshare with Volka his delight in the trouble Goga was deservedly having. \"No  one  but I  can ever break the spell,\"  he thought. \"I  can  just\\nimagine how the most greatly-respected Volka ibn Alyosha will be pleased and\\nhow amazed he will be at the endless variety of my powers.\" \"Pill?\" Volka repeated  absently, for he had  just  thought  of  a very\\nsimple  and  tempting  idea. \"Pill? He\\'s  not  feeling  too  good. Listen,\\nHottabych,\" he crouched down and stuck his head  under the bed,  in order to\\ncarry on negotiations more comfortably. \"I  want  to  ask  you  for  a  big\\nfavour.\" \"This is it,\" the old Genie thought unhappily. He suspected that  Volka\\nwas about to ask him  to break the spell he had cast on Goga; and he decided\\nto  refuse flatly. At least for the  time being. It wouldn\\'t hurt the horrid\\ntattle-tale and gossip to suffer a bit. It would only do him good. However. Hottabych replied sourly:\\n     \"I\\'ll be only too happy to know your wish.\" \"I want to ask you for a present.\"'),\n",

The  carpet rose over the highest trees, over the highest houses,  over\\nthe highest factory stacks and sailed over the city that was blinking with a\\nmillion  lights  below. They  could hear muffled  voices, automobile  horns,\\npeople singing in row boats on the river and the far-off music of a band. The city  was plunged in twilight,  but here, high  up in the air, they\\ncould  still  see the  crimson  ball of  the sun  sinking  slowly beyond the\\nhorizon. \"I wonder how high up we are now?\" Volka said thoughtfully. \"About 600  or  700 elbows,\" Hottabych  answered,  still  figuring  out\\nsomething on his fingers. Meanwhile,  the  carpet settled on  its course,  though  still  gaining\\nheight. Hottabych sat down majestically, crossing his legs and holding on to\\nhis hat. Volka tried to sit down cross-legged, as  Hottabych  had, but found\\nneither pleasure nor satisfaction from this position. He shut his eyes tight\\nto  overcome his  awful dizziness and sat down on  the  edge  of the carpet,\\ndangling  his legs over the side. Though this was more comfortable, the wind\\ntore  at his  legs  mercilessly; it blew them  off  to a side  and they were\\nconstantly at a sharp angle to  his body. He soon became convinced that this\\nmethod was no good either, and finally settled down with his  legs stretched\\nout before him on the carpet. In  no  time, he felt chilled to the bone. He thought sadly of his warm\\njacket that was so far below in his closet at home, hundreds of miles away. As a last resort, he decided  to warm up the way  cabbies used to do in\\nthe olden days, long before he was born. His father  once showed him  how it\\nwas done when they were out ice  skating. Volka began to slap his shoulders\\nand sides in sweeping motions, and in the twinkling of an eye he slipped off\\nthe carpet and into nothingness. Needless  to say, if he had not  grabbed  on to the  fringes, our story\\nwould have ended with this unusual air accident. Hottabych did not even notice what had happened to his young friend. He\\nwas sitting  with  his back to  Volka, his legs tucked under  him in Eastern\\nfashion and lost in thought. He was trying to recall  how to break spells he\\nhimself had cast. \"Hottabych!\" Volka howled,  feeling that he  wouldn\\'t  last long, as he\\nhung on to the fringes. \"Help, Hottabych!\" \"0 woe is me!\" the  old man cried, seeing that Volka was flying through\\nthe air. \"Shame on  my old grey head! I would have killed myself if you had\\nperished!\" Muttering and calling himself all kinds of names for being so careless,\\nhe dragged a petrified Volka back up on the carpet, sat him down and put his\\narm around the boy, firmly resolved not to let go of him until they landed. \"It would be  g-g-good t-t-to h-h-have s-s-something w-w-warm to wear!\" Volka said wistfully through chattering teeth.'),\n",

Hottabych was silent for a moment, looking at the boy closely to decide\\nwhether or not he was worth a kind word. He apparently became convinced that\\nVolka had not made  a mistake  in choosing his friend and so smiled his most\\namiable smile. \"There is no end to my happiness at meeting you. Any friend of my young\\nmaster is my best friend.\" \"Master?\" Zhenya asked. \"Master and saviour.\" \"Saviour?!\" Zhenya repeated and giggled. \"There\\'s no need to laugh,\" Volka stopped him sternly. \"There\\'s nothing\\nto laugh about.\" In  as  few words as possible, he told  Zhenya everything our attentive\\nreaders already know.

Twice that day the magic carpet  passed through heavy cloud  banks, and\\neach time Hottabych\\'s nearly dry beard would again become so  damp it was no\\nuse thinking about even the simplest kind  of magic-something that would get\\nthem  some food,  for  instance. They were  beginning  to feel  hungry. Even\\nZhenya\\'s  description of his adventures  of the previous day  could not take\\ntheir minds away from food. But, most  important, there was no end to their\\nflight in sight. They were hungry, bored, and extremely uncomfortable. The carpet seemed\\nto be  stuck  in mid-air,  so slowly  did it fly and  so monotonous was  the\\nsteppe stretching far below them. At times, cities or little blue ribbons of\\nrivers would drift by  slowly, and  then  once  again they saw  nothing  but\\nsteppe and endless fields of ripening wheat. Zhenya was right in saying they\\nwere flying over the southern part of the country. Then, suddenly, ahead and\\nto  the  right of them,  as far as the  eye could see, there  was blue water\\nbelow. To the left was the ragged line of distant mountains. \"It\\'s the Black Sea!\" the boys shouted in unison. \"0 woe is us,\" Hottabych cried. \"We\\'re going straight out to sea!\" Fortunately, a capricious air  current turned the  carpet a  bit to the\\nleft and  tossed  it into another  cloud  bank at  top speed. Thus,  it was\\ncarried along the Caucasian coastline. Through an opening in the clouds, Zhenya noticed the city of Tuapse far\\nbelow, its boats on anchor at the long, jutting pier. Then everything was lost in a thick fog again. Our travellers\\' clothing\\nonce   again-for  the   hundredth  time!-became   wet. The  carpet  was  so\\nwater-logged and heavy that it began to fall sharply with a whistling sound. In  a few short seconds the  clouds were left  far  above. Soon, the  famous\\nresort  city of Sochi flashed by below in the blinding  rays of the  setting\\nsun.

And if you want to know, he didn\\'t go off to call any guards, he went to get\\nus something to eat.\" \"You\\'re too young to teach me, 0  Volka!\" Hottabych snapped, for he was\\nreally displeased that his  young companions were not in the least  thankful\\nfor having been saved from death\\'s jaws. \"Who but I should know what rulers\\nlook like and how  they  behave! Know ye, that there are no more treacherous\\nmen than sultans.\" \"But  he\\'s  no  sultan,  he\\'s a  foreman.

If  all the people at the  sanatorium were not then in the dining hall,\\nthey  probably would  have seen a pair of striped pyjamas appear suddenly in\\nthe dark sky, coming from the direction of Matsesta, flying at the height of\\nthe third-storey windows. The  pyjamas flew into Muhammedov\\'s  room  through\\nthe open  balcony doors and  draped themselves neatly  over the back of  the\\nchair, from which the  kind drilling foreman had  so recently picked them up\\nand handed them to a shivering Hottabych.

Bowing  smartly to all sides like an old-timer on the stage,  Hottabych\\ntook two ping-pong balls from a table and threw them into the air. Suddenly,\\nthere were four balls; he  threw  them up again  and they became eight, then\\nthirty-two. He  began  juggling  all  thirty-two   balls,   and  then  they\\ndisappeared  and were found to be in thirty-two pockets of thirty-two people\\nin the audience. Then they flew out of the pockets, formed a chain and began\\nspinning around  a bowing Hottabych like sputniks until  they became a white\\nhoop. Hottabych put this large hoop  on Varvara Stepanovna\\'s lap with a  low\\nbow. The hoop began to flatten out  until it turned into a roll of excellent\\nsilk. Hottabych  cut it  into pieces with Volka\\'s  pen-knife. The pieces  of\\nsilk flew into  the  air  like birds and  wound themselves  into turbans  of\\nremarkable beauty around the heads of the amazed audience. Hottabych  listened to  the applause  blissfully. Then  he snapped his\\nfingers. The turbans  turned into  pigeons which flew out  through the  open\\nport-holes and  disappeared. Everyone was now convinced that  the old man in\\nthe funny oriental slippers was one of the greatest conjurors. Hottabych wallowed  in the  applause. The  boys knew him well enough to\\nunderstand how dangerous such unanimous and exciting approval was for him. \"Just wait  and see!'),\n",

The fish slapped its tail\\nagainst the water, jumped out of the aquarium and turned into Hottabych. \"Whew!\" the  old man said, shaking  off the water and wiping his  beard\\nwith a magnificent towel embroidered with gold and silver roosters which had\\nappeared from thin air. \"I\\'ve been waiting to offer my respects all morning,\\nbut you wouldn\\'t wake up and I  didn\\'t have the heart to waken you. So I had\\nto  spend  the  night with  these pretty  fishes,  0 most  happy  Volka  ibn\\nAlyosha!\" \"Aren\\'t  you ashamed  of  yourself for  making fun of  me!\" Volka  said\\nangrily. \"It\\'s really a poor joke to call a boy with a beard happy!\" WHY S. S. PIYORAKI BECAME LESS TALKATIVE\\n\\n\\n     This wonderful morning Stepan Stepanych Pivoraki decided to combine two\\njoys at once. He decided to shave, while taking  in the picturesque  view of\\nthe Moskva River. He moved the little table with his shaving things close to\\nthe window and began to lather his cheeks  as he  hummed  a merry tune. We\\'d\\nlike to pause here and say a few words about our new acquaintance. Pivoraki was a very talkative man, a trait which often made him, though\\nhe was actually no fool and very well read, extremely tiresome, even  to his\\nbest friends. On the whole, however,  he was a nice person  and a great master of his\\ntrade-which was pattern-making. When he had  finished lathering his cheeks, Stepan Stepanych  picked up\\nhis razor,  drew it back and forth over his  palm, and  then began to  shave\\nwith the greatest ease and skill. When he had finished  shaving,  he sprayed\\nsome \"Magnolia\" cologne  on his face and then began to wipe his razor clean. Suddenly,  an  old  man  in a white  suit and  gold-embroidered,  petal-pink\\nmorocco slippers with queer turned-up toes appeared beside him. \"Are you  a barber?\" the old man asked a flabbergasted Stepan Stepanych\\nin a stern voice. \"No, I\\'m not a professional barber. However,  on the other hand, I  can\\ntruthfully say I am a barber, because,  while I  am not actually a barber, I\\nam a match  for any professional barber, for not a  single  barber can outdo\\nme. And do you know why? Because, while a professional barber....\"\\n     The old man interrupted the chattering Pivoraki rudely:\\n     \"Can you,  0 unnecessarily talkative barber, shave a young man well and\\nwithout cutting  him once, although you are not even  worthy of  kissing the\\ndust beneath his feet?\"'),\n",

       "   'Really now, try to imagine yourself in his place. He had left the house\\nin the morning to take a geography examination, then go to the movies and be\\nback for supper  as expected, at six-thirty. Instead, he was returning after\\nnine, having failed his examination miserably, and, what was most  horrible,\\nwith shaved cheeks! And him not even thirteen yet! No  matter how he racked\\nhis brains, he could  not find  a solution. Thus, without  having thought of\\nanything,  he dragged his feet  back to his quiet  side street, now  full of\\nlong evening shadows. He walked  past the  surprised janitor,  entered  the downstairs  hall,\\nclimbed a flight of stairs and,  with a heavy sigh,  pressed  the  bell. He\\ncould hear someone\\'s steps, and a strange voice asked through the door:\\n     \"Who\\'s there?\" \"It\\'s  me,\"  Volka wanted to say, but suddenly remembered  that, as  of\\nthis morning, he didn\\'t live there any more. Without  answering the new  tenant, he  ran downstairs, marched  by the\\nstill puzzled  janitor nonchalantly, reached the main  street, and boarded a\\ntrolley-bus. This certainly was his unlucky day: somewhere, most probably at\\nthe  movies, he had lost his change-purse, so he had  to  get  out  and walk\\nhome. Least of all, Volka wanted to meet a classmate, but most unbearable was\\nthe thought  that  he would have  to face Goga-the-Pill. Sly Fate  had added\\ninsult  to injury: from this day forth they were both to  live  in the  same\\nhouse. Sure enough, no sooner did  he enter the yard of  his new house than an\\nunbearable, familiar voice shouted:\\n     \"Hi, nutty! Who was the old bird you left school with today?\" Goga-the-Pill  ran up to Volka, winking insolently and pulling the most\\ninsulting faces. \"He wasn\\'t an old bird, he was a nice old man,\"  Volka  said peaceably,\\nas he  didn\\'t want to end the day with  a fight. \"He\\'s ... he\\'s  my father\\'s\\nfriend from Tashkent.\" \"What if I je-ee-st go to your father  and je-ee-st tell him about your\\nmonkey-business at the exam!\" \"Oh, Pill, you\\'ve gone crying for a beating too long!\" Volka flared up,\\nimagining what an impression Pill\\'s words would have on his  parents. \"Why,\\nyou dirty tattle-tale! I\\'ll push your face in!\" \"Now, now,  take it easy! A  person  can\\'t even  joke  any more. You\\'re\\nreally a nut!\" Fearing  Volka\\'s  fists, which, after several encounters, Goga chose to\\navoid, he dashed headlong into the entrance of the house in which he was now\\nto live in dangerous closeness to Volka, whose new apartment was on the same\\nlanding. \"Bald  people! A country of bald people!\" Goga  shouted, sticking his\\nhead out the front door. He showed Volka his tongue and, fearing the other\\'s\\nrighteous anger, flew up the stairs, two at a time, to his own door. However,  he was  distracted by  the  mysterious behaviour  of  a  huge\\nSiberian cat  from apartment 43.'),\n",

Soon they flew into a familiar room, where Volka Kostylkov sat sadly on\\nhis bed, moaning every time he looked at himself and his bristly chin in the\\nmirror. \"Happiness and luck accompany  you in all your undertakings, 0 my young\\nmaster!\" Hottabych  announced triumphantly, still holding on to  the kicking\\nStepan Stepanych. \"I was about  to despair of ever finding you a barber when\\nI suddenly came upon  this unusually talkative man, and I brought him  along\\nto  this room beneath the blessed roof of your house. Here he is before you,\\nwith everything necessary for shaving. And now,\" he said to Pivoraki who was\\ngaping  at  the bristly boy,  \"lay out your  tools  properly and shave  this\\nhonourable youth  so that his cheeks become as smooth  as those  of a  young\\nmaiden.\" Pivoraki  stopped struggling. The razor glistened in his  skilled  hand\\nand a few minutes later Volka was excellently shaved. \"Now  put away your tools,\" the old  man  said. \"I\\'ll fly over for you\\nagain early tomorrow morning, and you\\'ll shave this youth once more.\" \"I can\\'t come tomorrow,\"  Pivoraki objected in a tired  voice. \"I\\'m  in\\nthe morning shift tomorrow.\" \"That doesn\\'t  concern  me in  the  least,\" Hottabych replied  icily. A\\nheavy  silence fell on  the room. Suddenly, Stepan  Stepanych had  a bright\\nidea. \"Why don\\'t you try a Tbilisi preparation? It\\'s an excellent remedy.\" \"Is  that  some  kind of a  powder?\" Volka  interrupted. \"Isn\\'t that a\\ngreyish powder? I heard about it, or read something about it....\"\\n     \"Yes, that\\'s it! A greyish powder!\" Pivoraki cried happily. \"It\\'s  made\\nin Georgia, a wonderful and sunny land. I personally am crazy about Georgia. I\\'ve travelled back and  forth across all the roads in the country during my\\nmany vacations. Sukhumi, Tbilisi, Kutaisi... .

Naturally, it\\'ll grow back again after a while.\" \"It won\\'t grow back in my young friend\\'s case,\" Hottabych interrupted. \"Are you positive?\" Hottabych assumed a haughty expression and said nothing. He  considered\\nit beneath his dignity to take a lowly barber into his confidence. A  short  minute later,  an  old  man wearing  an  old-fashioned  straw\\n-boater,  a white linen suit and  pink morocco  slippers with turned-up toes\\nwas seen in the locker room of a local bath-house in Tbilisi. Without  bothering to  get  undressed, he entered  the steam  room. The\\nsmell  of sulphur stung his nostrils, but this  was to be expected, as these\\nwere  the famous  Tbilisi sulphur baths. However,  a  person  entering  the\\ncrowded, steam-filled room fully dressed could not but attract the attention\\nof the other patrons.

But  Volka  would  not stop, though no  one took his words\\nseriously. \"So  you say the old man is shifting the goal  posts from over here, in\\nthe North  Section?\" People roared with laughter. \"Ha, ha, ha! He probably\\nhas  a  special gimmick in his pocket to regulate the goals at  a  distance. Maybe he even tossed all those balls into the field?\" \"Sure, it was him,\"  Volka agreed readily,  calling forth a new wave of\\nlaughter. \"I  bet he was also responsible for the  earthquake in Chile! Ho-ho-ho! Ha-ha-ha!\" \"No,  he  wasn\\'t  responsible for  that.\" Volka was  an honest boy. \"An\\nearthquake is the  result of a catastrophic shifting  of soil. Especially in\\nChile.

Strange things  kept  happening to the Zubilo players. They seemed  to\\nhave forgotten how to  play: their tackling was amazingly feeble and stupid.

Thus began the only  conference of shipwrecked people in the history of\\nsailing, in which the speakers expressed their  opinions  while floating  on\\ntheir backs. \"Well,  we\\'re  shipwrecked!\" Volka   said  with  something   close  to\\nsatisfaction. He  had taken upon himself the duties of  chairman. \"What are\\nyou planning  to  do?\" he asked, noticing that  Hottabych had begun  yanking\\nhairs from his beard with his free hand. \"I want to return  our  ship. It\\'s a great stroke of luck that my beard\\nis completely dry.\" \"There\\'s no hurry,\" Volka  interrupted. \"The question is: do we want to\\nreturn to it or not? I, for one, do not. To tell  you the truth,  there are\\ninhuman rules aboard. It\\'s disgusting to even think of it.\" \"I agree. The \\'Sweet  Omar\\' is out of the question,\" Zhenya added.'),\n",

The\\nsimplest thing to do would have been to fly  somewhere farther south, but in\\nthe pitch darkness of  the  southern night they  might  easily crash  into a\\nmountain. For  the time being, they took refuge under some bushes and  considered\\nwhere to go. \\'\"I\\'ve  got  it!\" Zhenya cried,  jumping to  his feet. \"Golly, what  an\\nidea! We should smear his beard with oil!\" \"And then what?\" the old man shrugged. \"Then it won\\'t even get wet in another Flood, that\\'s what!\" \"Zhenya\\'s right,\" Volka agreed, feeling a bit peeved that it was not he\\nwho had thought of such a  wonderful, scientifically sound idea. \"Hottabych,\\ngo into action!\" Hottabych yanked out  several  hairs, tore one of them in  two, and his\\nbeard became covered with a thin layer of excellent palm oil. Then he tore  a second hair  in two and they all found themselves  in a\\ncomfortable, marble-faced cave that suddenly appeared on the steep bank. And\\nwhile  a warm June storm was booming  loudly  over the Caucasian coast, they\\nsat on thick carpets, had a plentiful  dinner and  then fell asleep  soundly\\ntill morning. They were awakened by the soft whispering of the crystal-clear waves. The sun had long since risen. Stretching  and yawning,  they went out onto the deserted beach, bathed\\nin the  slanting rays of  the morning sun. Immediately, as  if it  had never\\nexisted, the cave that had sheltered them for the night disappeared. The boys were splashing delightedly in the cool waves  when they  heard\\nthe  far-off hum of  an  airplane motor coming from the  direction  of Adler\\nAirport. A large  passenger  plane with glistening silver wings  was flying over\\nthe sea. \"Ah-h!\" Zhenya sighed dreamily. \"Wouldn\\'t it be nice if  we could go to\\nMoscow in that plane?\" \"That\\'s not a bad idea at all,\" Volka agreed. Thereupon Hottabych drew something very thin and white from his pocket. It  resembled a delicate silver thread. He  tore it into several pieces and\\nsuddenly all three of them found themselves  in comfortable reclining  seats\\ninside the airplane. The  most  surprising thing was that none of the  passengers  paid  the\\nslightest attention to them, as if they had been aboard the plane right from\\nthe start. \"Hottabych,\"  Zhenya whispered. \"What was it you  tore that looked just\\nlike a silver thread?\" \"Just a little hair from my beard,\" Hottabych replied, though he seemed\\nstrangely embarrassed. \"But you took it from your pocket.\" \"I tore it out of my beard beforehand and hid it in my pocket, just ...\\nin case.... Forgive me, but I wasn\\'t sure my oiled beard would stay dry.\" \"Don\\'t you believe in science?\" Zhenya cried in amazement. \"I am quite  well  versed in  the  sciences,\" Hottabych  said in a hurt\\nvoice, \"but I  don\\'t know what kind of  a  science teaches you  to protect a\\nmagic beard from getting wet by oiling it.\" To change  the subject  he said,\\n\"How comfortable and speedy this air chariot is!'),\n",

Mr.  Moneybags opened his eyes,  saw the  bags of money;  jumped to his\\nfeet, counted the bags and saw  that there were exactly one hundred of them. However, his happy smile soon vanished. No sooner had his shaking hands tied\\nthe valuable sack than his eyes once again began to glitter greedily. He pressed the sack to his fat  chest, turned the ring around again and\\nshouted heatedly:\\n     \"One hundred bags is little! I want immediately one million! Right away\\nnow!\" He barely had time to jump aside when a huge sack weighing at least ten\\ntons crashed to the ground. The force of the crash split the canvas sack and\\na  million bags  of  money  spilled  out on the  grass. Each bag contained a\\nhundred bills. These bills in no  way differed from  real money,  except  for the fact\\nthat they  all had the same serial number. This was the number Hottabych had\\nseen on the bill the greedy owner of the magic ring had shown him. Mr. Moneybags would certainly have  been grieved  to discover this, for\\nany bank-teller would have noticed that all  the numbers were the same,  and\\nthat would mean it was counterfeit money. However, Mr. Moneybags had no time\\nto check the serial numbers  just now. Pale from excitement,  he  climbed to\\nthe top  of the precious  pile  and  stood  up to  his  full  height  like a\\nmonument,  like a  living  embodiment  of greed. Mr.  Moneybag\\'s  hair  was\\ndishevelled,  his  eyes burned with insane fire, his hands trembled and  his\\nheart thundered in his breast. \"And now ... and now... and now I want ten thousand gold watches strewn\\nwith diamonds,  twenty thousand gold cigarette cases, thirty  . .. no, fifty\\nthousand  strings of  pearls, fifteen thousand  antique  China services!\" he\\nshouted darting back and forth in order to dodge the great treasures falling\\nfrom all sides. \"0 red-faced  foreigner, don\\'t  you think what  you  have  received  is\\nenough?\" Hottabych asked sternly. \"Silence!\" Mr. Moneybags yelled and stamped his feet in rage. \"When the\\nboss do business, the servant must silence! Ring, do as my wish is! Fast!\" \"Go back where you came from, you  old grabber!\" Volka shouted. \"Out of\\nour country! We\\'ll propel you out of here!\" \"May it be so,\" Hottabych agreed and yanked four hairs from his beard. That very  moment the sacks of money, the crates  of china, watches and\\nnecklaces,  everything   the  silver  ring  had  brought-  disappeared. Mr.\\nMoneybags  himself  rolled down the grass  and along the  path very quickly,\\nheading in the direction from which he  had recently come so full of  hopes. In no time he was gone with just a little puff of dust to show where he  had\\nbeen. After the boys had regained their composure and calmed down, Volka said\\nin a thoughtful tone, \"I can\\'t understand what sort of a  ring it is-a plain\\none or a magic one?\" \"Why, a plain one, of course,\" Hottabych answered kindly.'),\n",

The old man would have been as good  as dead if not for Volka. He ran  to a\\nside and shouted at the top of his voice:\\n     \"Over here! Who needs an extra ticket? Who needs some extra tickets?\" At these magic words the people who had been closing in on a distraught\\nHottabych  rushed towards  Volka,  but  the boy darted  into  the crowd  and\\ndisappeared.

ICE-CREAM AGAIN\\n\\n\\n     No sooner  had the  friends found their seats, than  a  girl in a white\\napron carrying a white lacquered box approached them. \"Would  you like  some ice-cream?\" she asked  and  shrieked. We must be\\nfair. Anyone else in her place would have been just as frightened, for what\\nanswer could an ice-cream vendor expect? In the best of cases:  \"Yes, thank you. Two,  please.\" In the  worst of\\ncases: \"No, thank you.\" Now, just imagine that upon hearing the young lady\\'s polite question, a\\nlittle  old man in a straw boater turned  as red as a beet,  his eyes became\\nbloodshot and he bristled all over. He leaned over to her and whispered in a\\nfierce voice:\\n     \"A-a-ah! You want to kill me with your foul ice-cream! Well, you won\\'t,\\ndespicable thing! The forty-six ice-creams  which I, old fool that I am, ate\\nin the circus nearly sent me to my grave. They have been enough to last me the  rest of my life.

Suddenly a boy with sun-bleached eyebrows on his freckled face hung onto the\\nold man\\'s arms and shouted in a frightened voice, \"She\\'s not to blame if you\\nwere greedy and stuffed yourself  with ice-cream! Please sit down, and don\\'t\\nbe silly!\" \"I hear and  I obey,\" the old man answered obediently. He let down his\\narms  and resumed  his seat. Then he addressed the  frightened young lady as\\nfollows, \"You  can go now. I forgive  you. Live in peace and be grateful  to\\nthis youth till the end of your days, for he has saved your life.\" The young  lady did not appear in their section again for the remainder\\nof the afternoon. HOW MANY FOOTBALLS DO YOU NEED? Meanwhile, the stadium was full of that very special festive atmosphere\\nwhich pervades it during decisive  football matches. Loud-speakers blared. A\\nhundred thousand people were heatedly discussing the possible outcome of the\\ngame, thus giving rise  to  a hum of human  voices  incomparable to anything\\nelse.

The Shaiba defence  had become  unkeyed from their  long  idleness  and\\ncould not collect their wits quickly to  ward  off  the  unexpected  danger. Their goalie was  really something  to look at. There he sat on  the  grass,\\nshelling melon seeds. Choking,  he jumped to  his feet,  but the Zubilo players  had  already\\nkicked the ball straight towards the centre of the unprotected goal.

Volka was about to  feel offended. However, he  blushed as he recalled\\nthat he had no one to blame but himself. Avoiding the old man\\'s honest eyes,\\nhe asked him never again to call him a dope, for he was not worthy of such a\\ngreat honour. \"I praise your modesty,  0 priceless Volka ibn Alyosha,\" Hottabych said\\nwith great respect. \"When  can  we  start?\" Volka  asked,  still  unable  to  overcome his\\nembarrassment. \"Right now, if you wish.\" \"Then let\\'s be off!\" However, he added anxiously, \"I don\\'t know what to\\ndo about Father  and  Mother.

On the whole,  however,  it was wonderfully preserved\\nand the fringes were as good as new. Volka thought he had seen exactly  the\\nsame  kind  of  carpet before, but  he could not  recall whether  it was  in\\nZhenya\\'s house or in the Teachers\\' Room at school. They took off from  the river bank  without a  single witness  to their\\ndeparture. Hottabych  took Volka\\'s hand and stood  him  in the middle of the\\ncarpet  beside himself;  he then yanked three hairs from  his beard, blew on\\nthem,  and  whispered  something,  rolling  his  eyes  skyward. The  carpet\\ntrembled. One after the other, all four tassled corners rose. Then the edges\\nbuckled and rose, but the middle remained on the grass, weighted down by the\\ntwo heavy passengers. After fluttering a bit, the carpet became motionless. The old man bustled about in confusion. \"Excuse  me, 0 kind Volka. There\\'s been a mistake somewheres. I\\'ll fix\\neverything in a minute.\" Hottabych  was quiet as he did some complex figuring on his fingers. He\\napparently got the  right answer, because he beamed.

Everyone  except those  standing watch  gathered  on  the spardeck. The\\ncaptain said, \"Comrades, this is  an emergency. There\\'s only one way to  get\\noff the  shoal under our own steam and that\\'s transfer the coal from the bow\\nto the stern; then we\\'ll be able make free of the shoal. If everyone pitches\\nin, it won\\'t take more than ten or twelve hours to do the job. The boatswain\\nwill  divide you into teams. Put  on your worst clothes  and let\\'s start the\\nball rolling. \"You, boys, and  you, Hassan Hottabych, need not  worry. its  is no job\\nfor you: the boys are too young and it\\'s a  little too late for you to carry\\nheavy loads.\" \"What do  you mean  by  saying I  can\\'t carry heavy  loads?\" Hottabych\\nreplied scornfully. \"Please be informed that no one present here  can  equal\\nme in weight-lifting, 0 most respected captain.\" The other passengers began to smile. \"What  an  old  man!\" \"Listen  to  him  boast.\"'),\n",

An approving murmur passed through the\\ncrowd  and a stout man  said to his  neighbour: \"I told you that the old man\\nwas one of them. You can tell he\\'s a very experienced clown. Look how funny\\nhe is. Sometimes they sit in with the audience on purpose.\" Fortunately  for the man, Hottabych heard nothing of what \\'he said,  as\\nhe was  engrossed in watching the magician. Sidorelli was about to begin his\\nmost difficult trick. First of all, the famous illusionist set fire  to several long coloured\\nribbons and stuffed them into his mouth. Then he picked up a large, brightly\\ncoloured bowl filled with something that looked like sawdust. He stuffed his\\nmouth full of the sawdust  and began to fan himself quickly with a beautiful\\ngreen fan. The sawdust in his mouth began to smoulder. Then a wisp of smoke\\nappeared  and,  finally,  when  the  lights  were turned  out,  everyone saw\\nthousands  of sparks and even a small flame shoot from the famous magician\\'s\\nmouth. Then,  amidst  a  storm of applause  and  shouts of Bravo! Hottabych\\'s\\nindignant voice could be heard. \"It\\'s  a fake!\" he shouted at the top of  his  lungs. \"That\\'s no magic! It\\'s simple sleight-of-hand!\" \"Isn\\'t he something!\" someone shouted. \"A  wonderful  clown! Bravo, clown!\" And everyone  present except Volka\\nand his friend applauded Hottabych enthusiastically. The old man did not understand which clown they were shouting about. He\\nwaited for the applause he had inspired to die down and continued acidly:\\n     \"What kind of magic is that! Ha, ha, ha!\" He  shoved  the  thunderstruck  magician aside. To begin with, fifteen\\ntremendous multi-coloured flames shot from his mouth; they were so real that\\na smell of burning filled the circus. The  applause was  balm  to Hottabych\\'s  heart. Then  he  snapped  his\\nfingers, and instead of one large Sidorelli, seventy-two tiny Sidorellis ran\\noff in single file along the barrier surrounding the arena. After completing\\nseveral circles, they blended into one  large Sidorelli  again, just as tiny\\ndrops of mercury roll together to form a large drop. \"That\\'s not  all!\" Hottabych thundered  in a  voice that was no  longer\\nhuman. He was excited  by the admiration he had aroused,  and began to draw\\nforth herds of horses from under the flaps of his jacket. The  horses whinnied with fear, they pawed the  ground and tossed their\\nheads, making their lovely silken manes blow. Then, at a signal from the old\\nman, the  horses  disappeared. Instead, four  huge,  roaring  African  lions\\njumped out from under his  jacket. They raced around the arena several times\\nand also disappeared. There was an unending storm of applause from that moment on. Hottabych waved his hand and everything on the arena- Sidorelli and his\\nassistants, and his various  props, and the elegant uniformed attendants-all\\nshot into the air, completed several farewell circles  over the heads of the\\nastounded audience, and dissolved into nothing. Suddenly and from nowhere, a  huge African elephant with sly, twinkling\\neyes appeared on the arena.'),\n",

He  was  really  becoming\\nfrightened. \"Hottabych, can\\'t you see....\"\\n     Suddenly, he froze,  for  he felt  he had  lost  the gift of speech. He\\nwanted  to  throw himself  between the  old  man and the still  unsuspecting\\nwaitress, but found he could not move a finger. It was all  Hottabych\\'s doing. To prevent  Volka  from  interfering in\\nsomething he considered a matter of honour, he had  lightly  pinched his ear\\nlobe between the first  two fingers  of his left hand and had thus condemned\\nthe boy to silence and immobility. \"How did you reply to the order my young master gave you?\" he repeated. \"I\\'m afraid I don\\'t  understand you,\" the  waitress answered  politely. \"It was not an order, it was a request, and I went to fulfil it.

She  was the  only witness  of the\\ndisgraceful scene,  for there was no one besides Volka and Hottabych  in the\\ncafe. \"How can you be so rude? And especially a person your age!\" \"On your knees!\" Hottabych  roared. \"And you  get down  on your knees,\\ntoo,\" he added,  pointing to the cashier. \"And you!\" he  shouted to another\\nwaitress  who was rushing to the rescue. \"All three of you, get down on your\\nknees  immediately, and beg my young  friend\\'s  pardon!\" At  this, Hottabych\\nsuddenly began to grow bigger and bigger until finally  his head touched the\\nceiling. It  was a strange and terrible  sight. The  cashier and  the second\\nwaitress both fainted, but the first  waitress only  paled and said  calmly,\\n\"Shame on you! You should behave properly in public. And if you\\'re a decent\\nsort of hypnotist...\"\\n     (She thought the old man was practising hypnotic tricks on them.) \"On your  knees!\" Hottabych bellowed. \"Didn\\'t  you hear  me-  on  your\\nknees?!\" In all his  three thousand seven hundred and thirty-two years, this was\\nthe  first time ordinary mortals had refused to obey him. Hottabych felt the\\nboy would  lose respect for him, and he  was terribly anxious  to have Volka\\nrespect him and treasure his friendship. \"Down, 0 despicable one, if you value your life!\" \"That\\'s entirely out of the question,\" the brave waitress answered in a\\ntrembling voice. \"I  can\\'t understand why you\\'re  raising your voice.

Omar Asaf was as quiet as  a mouse. Not once did he leave the cabin. He\\ncrept back into  the copper vessel without a murmur when the \"Ladoga\" docked\\nto  the strains of a band  at its home  pier, from which it had sailed  away\\nthirty days before. Naturally,  Omar Asaf was extremely reluctant to return to his  bottle,\\nif even for  a short period, since he had already spent so  many unhappy and\\nlonely centuries there. But Volka gave him his word of  honour that he would\\nlet him out the minute they reached home. There is  no  use denying that as Volka left  the  hospitable \"Ladoga,\"\\ncarrying the copper vessel under his arm, he was sorely tempted to  toss  it\\ninto the water. But there  you are-if you\\'ve  given your word you\\'ve got  to\\nkeep  it. And  so  Volka walked down  the  gang-plank, having conquered this\\nmomentary temptation. If no one aboard the \"Ladoga\" ever stopped to wonder why Hottabych  and\\nhis friends  were taking part in the expedition, it is quite clear that  the\\nold  man  had no  trouble  casting  the  same spell  over his young friends\\'\\nparents and acquaintances. At  any  rate,  their relatives and friends accepted it as a  matter of\\ncourse that  the children had been in the Arctic, without questioning how in\\nthe world they had ever booked berths on the Ladoga.\" After an  excellent dinner, the children told their  respective parents\\nthe story  of their adventures in  the  Arctic, keeping  almost true to  the\\nfacts. They  were wise  enough to  say  nothing  about  Hottabych. Zhenya,\\nhowever, was so carried away, that the rash  words nearly slipped out of his\\nmouth.

However, this went unnoticed. Everyone looked at  him with awe, because\\nhe had  met and  talked with a real  live boatswain  every single day of the\\njourney. Volka,  on  the other  hand, nearly had  an  accident with  the  copper\\nbottle. He was  sitting  on  the  couch  in the dining room, explaining the\\ndifference between an ice-breaker and an iceboat to his parents with a  true\\nknowledge  of  his subject. He  did not notice  his grandmother leaving the\\nroom. After she had been gone for about five minutes,  she  returned holding\\n... the vessel with Omar Asaf inside! \"What\\'s this? Where did you get it. Mother?\" Volka\\'s father asked. \"Just imagine, I found it in Volka\\'s suitcase. I started unpacking  his\\nthings  and found this very  nice pitcher. It will  be lovely as a decanter. I\\'ll have to polish it, though, because it\\'s so terribly green.\" \"That\\'s  no  decanter!\" Volka  cried and  turned pale.

During the several thousand years of Hottabych\\'s life, he had often had\\nto do with people feeling sad and gloomy, and he knew how to cheer them  up. At any rate, he was convinced he knew how to do so. All that was  needed was\\nto  give a  person  that which he had always longed for. But  what kind of a\\npresent should he give Volka? The  answer came to him quite  by chance when\\nVolka asked a passer-by:\\n     \"Would you please tell me what time it is?\" The man looked at his watch and said, \"Five to two.\" \"Thank you,\" Volka said and continued on in silence. Hottabych was the first to speak. \"Tell me,  0 Volka,  how was the  man able to tell  the time  of day so\\naccurately?\" \"Didn\\'t you see him look at his watch?\" The old man raised his eyebrows\\nin surprise. \"His watch?!\" \"Sure, his watch,\"  Volka  explained. \"He had a watch on\\nhis\\n     wrist. The round chrome-plated thing.\" \"Why don\\'t you have such a watch, 0 most noble of all Genie-saviours?\" \"I\\'m too young to have such a watch,\" Volka answered humbly. \"May I be permitted, 0 honourable passer-by, to inquire  as to the time\\nof day?\" Hottabych said, stopping the first person he saw and staring at his\\nwatch. \"Two  minutes to two,\"  the  man answered,  somewhat surprised  at  the\\nflowery language. Thanking him in the most elaborate oriental manner, Hottabych said with\\na sly grin:\\n     \"May I be permitted,  0 loveliest of all Volkas,  to inquire  as to the\\ntime of day?\" And there was a watch  shining  on Volka\\'s left wrist, exactly like the\\none the man they had stopped had, but instead of being chrome-plated, it was\\nof the purest gold. \"May it be worthy of your hand  and your kind heart,\" Hottabych said in\\na touched voice, basking in Volka\\'s happiness and surprise. Then Volka did something that any other boy  or girl would have done in\\nhis place,  having  found themselves  the  proud  possessors of their  first\\nwatch. He raised his arm to his ear to hear it tick. \"O-o-o-o,\" he drawled. \"It\\'s not wound. I\\'ll have to wind  it.\" To his\\ngreat disappointment, he found he could not move the winding button. Then he\\ngot out his  pen-knife to open the watch case. However, try as he would,  he\\ncould not find a trace of a slit in which to insert the knife. \"It\\'s made of solid gold,\" the old man boasted and winked. \"I\\'m not one\\nof those people who give presents made of hollow gold.\" \"Does  that  mean  there\\'s  nothing inside  of it?\" Volka  asked  with\\ndisappointment. \"Why,  should  there  be  anything  inside?\" the  old  Genie  inquired\\nanxiously.

Anyway, if she had promised to buy him a puppy, it meant she would.

After all, Goga had only taken his last exam several  hours before, and it\\'s\\nnot so easy to buy a puppy.

It\\'s  just  that  we\\'re  late  for  the  last  day-time\\nperformance! You have to be sixteen  to get in now. I really don\\'t know what\\nto do, \\'cause I don\\'t feel like going home.\" \"You won\\'t go home!\" Hottabych cried. \"In a twinkling of an eye they\\'ll\\nlet  us  through, surrounded by  the respect your truly endless capabilities\\ncommand! I\\'ll just have a  peek  at  those bits of paper everyone\\'s handing\\nthat stern-looking woman at the entrance.\" \"That  old  braggart!\" Volka thought irritably. Suddenly, he  felt two\\ntickets in his right fist. \"Come!\" Hottabych called, beaming again. \"Come, they\\'ll let you through\\nnow!\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Just as positive as that a great future awaits you!\" He  nudged  Volka towards a  mirror  hanging nearby.

AN UNUSUAL EVENT AT THE MOVIES\\n\\n\\n     A triumphant Hottabych dragged  Volka up the stairs to the second-floor\\nfoyer. At the entrance to the projection room stood Zhenya Bogorad, the envy\\nof every pupil of 6B. This darling of fate was the  theatre manager\\'s nephew\\nand  therefore permitted to attend evening performances. But  today, instead\\nof being the happiest  of boys, he was suffering terribly. He was suffering\\nfrom loneliness. He  was dying to have a companion, someone he could talk to\\nabout Volka Kostylkov\\'s  behaviour at  the  morning\\'s geography examination. Alas!

You may\\nconsider me  punished for lack of trust  and  you  won\\'t be wrong. I snorted\\nwhen I was  kind-heartedly offered a bowl  of  \\'taro\\' powder in that far-off\\nbath-house.

Then,  Omar Asaf,  a grouchy  and narrow-minded\\nGenie who turned into an Earth satellite because of his impossible character\\nand ignorant  scoffing  at scientific facts, will  be entered into the great\\nastronomical catalogue as a many-numbered figure. Someone who heard  of  this instructive tale  about Hottabych\\'s brother\\nonce told us in  all  seriousness that one night he had seen something flash\\nacross the  sky  which in shape resembled  an old  man  with  a long flowing\\nbeard. As concerns the author of  this book, he does  not believe the story,\\nfor Omar Asaf was a very insignificant man. HOTTABYCH\\'S FATAL PASSION\\n\\n     For several  days Hottabych remained in the  aquarium, pining  away for\\nhis brother. Gradually, however,  he got used to his absence  and once again\\neverything was back to normal. One day he and the boys were talking quietly. It was still rather early\\nand the old man was lolling under the bed. \"It looks like rain,\" Zhenya said, looking out the window. Soon the whole sky became overcast with clouds. It started to drizzle. \"Shall we turn it on?\" Volka asked off-handedly,  nodding towards a new\\nradio set his parents  had given him for being  promoted to 7B. He turned it\\non with obvious pleasure. The  loud  sounds of  a symphony  orchestra filled the room. Hottabych\\nstuck his head out from under the bed. \"Where are all those people playing so sweetly on various instruments?\" \"Golly! Hottabych doesn\\'t know anything about radios!\" Zhenya said. (There  was  one  omission  on  the  \"Ladoga\"  for  all  its  excellent\\nequipment-they forgot to install a radio set in the lounge.) For nearly two  hours  the  boys watched Hottabych delightedly. The old\\nman  was  overwhelmed. Volka  tuned  in  on  Vladivostok,  Tbilisi,   Kiev,\\nLeningrad, Minsk and Tashkent. Songs, thunderous marches, and the  voices of\\npeople speaking in many tongues  obediently poured forth from the set. Then\\nthe boys  got fed up. The  sun peeped out and they decided to go for a walk,\\nleaving  a  fascinated  Hottabych behind. The  strange  events  which  then\\noccurred remain a mystery to Volka\\'s grandmother to this very day. Soon  after the boys left,  she entered  Volka\\'s  room to turn off  the\\nradio and distinctly  heard an old man  coughing in the empty room. Then she\\nsaw the dial turn by itself and the indicator move along the scale. The  frightened  old  woman  decided  not to touch the set, but to find\\nVolka immediately. She caught up with  him at the  bus stop. Volka was very\\nupset. He said he  was  improving the set, that he was  making it automatic,\\nand  he begged his grandmother not to tell his  parents what she  had  seen,\\nbecause it was supposed to be a  surprise for them. His grandmother was  not\\nat all  comforted by  these words. Nevertheless,  she promised  to keep his\\nsecret. All afternoon she listened anxiously to the strange mumbling  coming\\nfrom the empty room. That day the radio played on and on.'),\n",

In  order  to  harden  the  old man\\'s  nerves, they crossed the busiest\\nstreets at least  twenty times. Then they  rode on a trolley-car  for a long\\nwhile and, finally, tired but content, they boarded a bus. They rode off, bouncing softly on the leather-upholstered seats. Volka  was engrossed  in  a copy  of Pionerskaya Pravda, the children\\'s\\nnewspaper. The  old man was lost in thought and kept  glancing at  his young\\ncompanion  kindly from time  to time. Then his face  broke  into  a  smile,\\nevidently reflecting some pleasant idea he had conceived. The bus took them to the doorstep. Soon they were back in Volka\\'s room. \"Do  you  know  what, 0 most  honourable of  secondary school  pupils?\" Hottabych began the minute the door closed  behind them. \"I think you should\\nbe more  aloof and reserved in your relations  with the young inhabitants of\\nyour house. Believe it or not, my heart was ready to break when I heard them\\nshouting:\\n     \\'Hey, Volka!\\' \\'Hello, Volka!\\' and so forth, all  of which  is obviously\\nunworthy  of you.

Oh, if not for the presence of the almighty  Volka, who had stopped\\nthe Sun itself with a single word, then Omar Asaf would certainly have known\\nhow to deal with the unruly boy! But Volka was standing beside them, and the\\nenraged Genie had no choice but to ask Zhenya  in  a wheedling voice to  let\\nhim have a look  at the great planet of  the  night through such interesting\\nbinoculars. \"I join my  brother  in asking you to do  him this  favour,\"  Hottabych\\nadded.

The  name  of  the vessel  was  the  \"Sweet  Omar,\"  in honour  of  the\\nunfortunate brother of our old friend, Hassan Abdurrakhman ibn Hottab. ABOARD THE \"SWEET OMAR\"\\n\\n\\n     Had our friend the conductor on  the Moscow-Odessa express miraculously\\nfound himself aboard the twin-masted  \"Sweet Omar,\" he would  not have  been\\nmost amazed  at the fact that he had suddenly found himself aboard a sailing\\nvessel,  nor that  this vessel did  not in any way resemble  a  usual sea or\\nriver  craft. He  would have been most amazed at finding that he was already\\nacquainted with the passengers and crew. The  old man and his  two young  companions who had  left Compartment 7\\nthat morning were its passengers, while the four dark-skinned citizens whose\\nterm of service dated back to the 16th century B.C. were its crew. One  can  well  imagine  that a second encounter would have landed  the\\nimpressive conductor in bed for a long time. Despite  the fact  that  Volka  and  Zhenya  had become  accustomed  to\\nwitnessing  the  most unexpected events during the past few days,  they were\\nmost  amazed  to  find  their  recent acquaintances aboard the  ship and  to\\ndiscover that they were also excellent sailors. After the  boys had stood gazing at  the quick and skilful movements of\\nthe small crew scurrying up and down the riggings just as if  they were on a\\npolished floor, they went  to explore  the rest  of  the ship. It was  very\\nbeautiful,  but  small-no  larger  than  a  Moscow  river  launch. However,\\nHottabych assured  them that even Sulayman, the Son of David, did not have a\\nship as big as the \"Sweet Omar.\" Everything  on the ship glittered with cleanliness  and  splendour. Its\\nsides and high, carved  bow  and stern were inlaid with gold  and ivory. The\\npriceless  rosewood deck was covered with rugs as magnificent as those which\\nadorned the cabins. That is why Volka was so surprised at suddenly coming  upon a dark  and\\nfilthy cubby-hole in the prow. In it were plank beds covered with rags. As he looked in disgust at  the meagre  furnishings of this  tiny room,\\nZhenya joined him. After careful scrutiny, Zhenya decided the unsightly hole\\nwas intended for the pirates they might capture on the way. \"Not  at all,\" Volka persisted. \"This place was forgotten about after a\\ncomplete overhauling. Sometimes, after repairs,  there\\'s a forgotten  corner\\nfull of rags and all kinds of rubbish.\" \"What do  you  mean  by \\'a complete overhauling\\' when this ship  didn\\'t\\neven exist this morning?\" Zhenya protested. Volka had no answer  to this  question, and so the boys set off to find\\nHottabych,  to ask him to help solve the mystery. But they found the old man\\nasleep and thus  did not speak to him until an  hour or two later, at dinner\\ntime.

The letter  from  the Central\\nExcursion Bureau would  have  been delivered  to  his parents; all sorts  of\\nquestions would have followed, resulting in such a mess, that he didn\\'t even\\ncare to think of it. The younger Kostylkov did not  often receive  mail  addressed  to  him,\\npersonally. In fact, not more than three or four times in all his life. That\\nis  why, when the postman said he  had  a letter  for him, Volka was greatly\\nsurprised. When he saw the return address of the Central Excursion Bureau he\\nwas stunned. He examined the envelope carefully and even smelled it, but it\\nonly  smelled  of the paste on the flap. With trembling fingers he opened it\\nand read  the section chief\\'s  short but polite  reply  several  times  over\\nwithout understanding a thing:\\n\\n     \"Dear Citizen H. Abdurrakhmanov,\\n     \"We regret to inform you that we received your  request too late. There\\nare no cabins left on the \\'Ladoga.\\' \"My best regards to your princes and sheiks. \"Sincerely yours,\\n     I. Domosedov, Section Chief of Long-Range Cruises.\" \"Can  it be that the old man tried  to  get  us on  the  \\'Ladoga\\'?\" it\\nsuddenly occurred to Volka. He was deeply touched. \"What a  wonderful  old\\nman! But I  don\\'t  understand which  princes and  sheiks this Domosedov  is\\nsending his regards to. I\\'ll find out right away, though.\" \"Hottabych! Hey, Hottabych!\" he shouted when he reached the river bank. \"Come here for a minute, will  you?\" The  old man was dozing in the shade of\\nthe great oak. When he heard Volka calling, he started, jumped  to his feet,\\nand shuffled over to the boy. \"Here I am, 0 goalie of my soul,\" he panted. \"I await your orders.\" \"Come clean now. Did you write to the Central Excursion Bureau?\" \"Yes, but  I wanted  it  to be  a surprise. Did  you receive an  answer\\nalready?\" \"Sure, here it is,\" Volka said, showing the old man the letter. Hottabych snatched the paper from him. After reading the tactful answer\\nslowly,  syllable  by syllable,  he turned purple  and began to tremble  all\\nover. His  eyes  became  bloodshot. In a  great  rage  he ripped  open his\\nembroidered collar. \"I beg your pardon,\" he wheezed,  \"I beg your pardon!'),\n",

She finally put a completely frightened Goga to bed, wrapped  him up in\\na  heavy quilt, though  it  was a  hot summer evening,  and ran down to  the\\ntelephone booth to call an ambulance. Since she should not tell them  the truth, she  was  forced to say that\\nher son had a very high fever and was delirious. Soon a  doctor arrived. He  was a  stout, middle-aged  man with a  grey\\nmoustache, many years of experience and an unruffled manner. The first  thing he  did,  naturally, was  to feel Goga\\'s  forehead. He\\ndiscovered the boy had no fever at all. This made him angry, but  he did not\\nshow it, since the boy\\'s mother looked so terribly grief-stricken. He sighed\\nand sat down on a chair by the bed. Then he asked Goga\\'s mother  to  explain\\nwhy she had called an ambulance instead of her regular doctor. She told him the truth. The  doctor  shrugged. He asked  her  to  repeat  her  story  from  the\\nbeginning. Then  he shrugged again, thinking that if this  were really true,\\nshe should have called a psychiatrist and not a general practitioner. \"Perhaps you think you are a dog?\" he asked Goga, as if casually. Goga shook his head. \"Well,  that\\'s something,\"  the  doctor thought. \"At  least it isn\\'t a\\nmania when people imagine they\\'re dogs.\" Naturally, he did not say this aloud, so as not to frighten the patient\\nor his mother, but it was obvious that the doctor was feeling more cheerful. \"Stick out your tongue,\" he said. Goga stuck out his tongue. \"It\\'s  a very normal-looking tongue. And now, young man, let  me listen\\nto your heart. Ah, an excellent heart. His lungs are clear. And how is his\\nstomach?\" . \"His stomach\\'s fine,\" his mother said. \"And has he been uh ... barking a long time?\" \"For over two hours. I just don\\'t know what to do.\" \"First of all, calm down. I don\\'t see anything terrible yet. Now, young\\nman, won\\'t you tell me how it all began?\" \"Well, it all began from nothing,\" Goga complained in a small voice. \"I\\nwas just telling my mother how Volka Kostylkov .bow-wow-wow.\" \"You see, doctor?\" his mother  sobbed loudly. \"It\\'s terrible. Maybe he\\nneeds some pills, or powders, or perhaps he needs a physic?\" The doctor frowned. \"Give me time  to  think, and I\\'ll look through  my books. It\\'s a  rare\\ncase, a very rare case, indeed.'),\n",

After all, you\\'re a young man and you should be dressed well. As a matter of\\nfact, some new clothes won\\'t harm any of us, will they?\" \"New clothes!\" Giovanni mimicked  angrily. \"When there\\'s so much sorrow\\nand  poverty  everywhere! First of  all, we\\'ll have to help Giacomo\\'s widow,\\nyou  know, the one who drowned last year and left three children and an  old\\nmother.\" \"You\\'re right,  Giovanni,\"  Pietro agreed. \"We should  help  Giacomo\\'s\\nwidow. He was a good and true friend.\" Then the  third fisherman entered  the  conversation. He  was a man  of\\nthirty, and his name was Cristoforo. \"What  about  Luigi? We should  give  him some  money,  too. The poor\\nfellow\\'s dying of tuberculosis.\" \"That\\'s right,\" Giovanni said. \"And Sybilla Capelli.

At about a quarter to nine his beaming face shot out\\nof the  water. The old  man  was  excited. He scrambled up  on  the  beach,\\ncarrying a large seaweed-covered metal object over his head. \"I found him, my friends!\" he yelled. \"I found the vessel in which  my\\nunfortunate  brother  Omar Asaf ibn  Hottab has  been  imprisoned these many\\ncenturies-may the sun always shine over him!

Then  he  made his elephant kneel and he took Zhenya up beside him. The\\nwhole cavalcade, swaying majestically, continued towards the village. On the way they met several children.

       "'This went on for a good five minutes until he finally seemed to come to\\na decision. He laughed so  fiendishly  as  to  give the  boys goose-pimples. Standing before Zhenya, he said maliciously:\\n     \"There  is no denying it, you are cunning. But Omar  Asaf ibn Hottab is\\nmore cunning than you, 0 despicable one.\" \"Omar  Asaf  ibn  Hottab?\" the boys  cried  in unison. The  Genie  was\\ntrembling with wrath and bellowed:\\n     \"Silence! Or  I\\'ll destroy you  immediately! Yes,  I  am Omar Asaf  ibn\\nHottab,  and I am more cunning  than this  brat! I\\'ll fulfil his wish and he\\nwill surely die of old age. But,\" he said, looking at the boys triumphantly,\\n\"his old age will come upon him before you count to a hundred!\" \"Help!\" Zhenya cried in his usual voice. \"Help!\" he  groaned in a deep\\nbasso  a few  seconds later. \"Help!\" he  squeaked  in a trembling old man\\'s\\nvoice a few\" moment\\'s later. \"Help! I\\'m dying!\" Volka looked on horror-struck as Zhenya  quickly turned into  a  youth,\\nthen into a grown man with a long black beard; then his beard turned to grey\\nand he became middle-aged; and, finally, he became a bald, bony, scrawny old\\nman. All  would  have been  over  in a few  seconds if Omar  Asaf,  who was\\ngleefully watching Zhenya\\'s quick deterioration, had not exclaimed:\\n     \"Oh,  if my unfortunate brother were  only here now! How happy he would\\nbe at my triumph!\" \"Wait!\" Volka  shouted. \"Tell me,  was  your  brother\\'s  name  Hassan\\nAbdurrakhman?\" \"How  did you  discover  that?\" Omar  Asaf asked  in amazement. \"Do not\\nremind me of him, for my heart is rent at the memory of poor Hassan. Yes,  I\\nhad a brother named so, but all the worse for you, for reopening my terrible\\nwounds!\" \"If  I tell you your brother is alive and bring  him to you, alive  and\\nhealthy, will you spare Zhenya then?\" \"Oh, if  I could only see  my dear Hassan! Oh, then  your  friend would\\nremain alive until he aged  naturally and that  will not happen for many and\\nmany a  year. But if you deceive  me ... I swear, neither of you will escape\\nmy rightful wrath!\" \"Then wait a minute, just one minute!\" Volka shouted. A few  moments later, he rushed into  the  lounge where  Hottabych  was\\nengrossed in his game of chess with the captain. \"Dear Hottabych,  hurry! Let\\'s  run back  to the cabin, there\\'s a great\\njoy awaiting you there.\" \"I can think of no  greater joy than  to check-mate my sweetest friend,\\nthe captain,\" Hottabych replied solemnly, studying the board intently. \"Hottabych, we can\\'t spare a minute! I beg you, come below with me!\" \"All right,\" Hottabych replied and moved his castle. \"Check! Run along,\\nVolka. I\\'ll be with you as soon as I win, and, according to my calculations,\\nthis will be in about three more moves.\" \"We\\'ll see  about that  yet,\" the captain  replied  cheerfully. \"Three\\nmoves indeed! Just you let me see....\"\\n     \"Yes, yes,  do see,\" the old man chuckled. \"You won\\'t think of anything\\nanyway. I can wait.'"
